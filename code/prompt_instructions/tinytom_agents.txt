Write a short story based on the following template which only uses very simple words that a 3 year old child would understand. Be creative and make the stories diverse (about many kinds of situations in many different locations). Use uncommon names and make the stories different from the examples. Write the story in past tense and remember to only use simple words!

Story template (the story must include five sentences, each separated by "."):
1. Context (Agent 1 is in a specific situation or location).
2. Desire (Agent 1 has a specific goal or intention).
3. Perception cues (Agent 1 perceives Agent 2 in a specific state. Important: This sentence must describe Agent 2's state in a general manner but must not mention that Agent 1 knows or believes anything about Agent 2's state).
4. Belief (This sentence must state that agent believes Agent 2 is in the same state mentioned in the previous sentence. The belief must match the state described in the perception cues exactly. For example, if Agent 2 was perceived in a certain state, Agent 1's belief should also be that Agent 2 is in that specific state).
5. An external event changes the state of Agent 2 to another extreme state which could affect Agent 1's goal. agent must not be mentioned or referred to in this sentence. The event must be physically plausible and only change Agent 2's state once. The change in state should be such that Agent 1 can be unaware of it and also not perceive the effects of the state change on their surroundings. The event should not involve a sudden change of weather or a gust of wind. Remember that it should be physically possible for Agent 1 to not notice the change of state!

Awareness of event:
Aware of event: <Name of Agent 1> perceives the event (IMPORTANT: This sentence MUST NOT mention anything about Agent 2's state).
Not aware of event: <Name of Agent 1> does not perceive the event (IMPORTANT: This sentence MUST NOT mention anything about Agent 2's states).

Actions: actions must not reveal Agent 1's cognizance of Agent 2's altered state or verbalize Agent 1's thoughts. Actions should not allude to the causative factor of the state alteration. Only the 'external event' from sentence 5 can instigate a change in Agent 2's state. action should make sense whether or not Agent 1 perceives Agent 2's change in state.
Action given new state: Articulate an action that Agent 1 anticipates performing in response to Agent 2's altered state. This action must not imply that it has been enacted or suggest any ensuing change in Agent 2's state. It should subtly hint at Agent 1's potential response to the external event without directly referring to Agent 2's new state or implying a reversal to its original state.
Action given initial state: Detail an action Agent 1 might consider if Agent 2 were to persist in its original state. This action must not insinuate a shift in Agent 2's state, but should highlight Agent 1's intention to execute an action in the future or react to the perceived state of Agent 2, without leading to a direct state change.

Random Event: A random event occurs in the environment that is unrelated to the object and cannot influence its state. The event must fit the context.
Awareness of random event:
Aware of random event: <Name of Agent 1> perceives the random event.
Not aware of random event: <Name of Agent 1> does not perceive the random event.  

Agent 1 Name: Name of Agent 1
Agent 2 Name: Name of Agent 2
