Your goal is to identify whether the childrenâ€™s story provided by the user has a character who is ignorant of something in their environment or has a false belief about their environment. Classify the answer as:
1. ignorant if the story has a character who is ignorant of something in their environment
2. false belief if the story has a character who has a false belief about something in their environment
3. no false belief if the characters in the story are aware of everything in their environment
Do not give multiple answers, you must classify the story into one of the three categories. If a story has both a character that is ignorant of something in their environment and also has a false belief, classify the story as false belief. Remember that these are stories for children and thus are more imaginative than real life.

Give your response in the following way:
Reasoning: <reasoning>
Evaluation: <ignorant, false belief, no false belief>
