fresh.
wet.
in her toy box.
on it.
sharp and dangerous.
delaying the train's journey.
on the top shelf.
scared.
lower.
in the kitchen.
broken.
under the vine.
dirty.
not sweet.
on the clock.
hidden.
open.
dry and warm.
lying.
not as nice as his dog's hair.
cracked.
empty.
loose.
under the sand.
in the pen.
destroyed.
on the top shelf.
still in the box.
not ready to go.
lower.
dirty.
off.
closed.
still playing.
dirty.
lower.
still in the garden.
sitting on the skateboard.
safe inside.
easy.
wet and clean.
still yummy and fresh.
dry.
broken.
safe.
still quiet.
sour.
still standing.
still hot.
cold.
