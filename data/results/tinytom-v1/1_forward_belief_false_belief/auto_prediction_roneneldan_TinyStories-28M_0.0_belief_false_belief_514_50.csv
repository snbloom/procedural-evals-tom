too heavy for the toy.
too burnt to eat.
a magical place.
absolutely amazing.
too dangerous.
full of treats, so she quickly unwrapped it and found a yummy treat.
so much fun to play with.
very special and he will always believe it is strong.

very important.
gone forever.
so cool.
so much fun, she just keeps playing and having fun.
the best thing she ever collected.

too strong for him to play on.
too tall to reach.
the most magical thing in the world.
very special and she will always believe in it.
too messy.
ruined.
going to fall.
not tough enough for her to climb.
going to crash.
special and he will keep it forever.
empty.
still fancy.
gone.
very special.
not safe anymore.
not working anymore.
very friendly and he is happy to have a new friend.
broken and she is sad.
too heavy for her to carry.
full of yucky, slimy goo.
not safe.
his new friend.

deaf.
the best friend ever.
