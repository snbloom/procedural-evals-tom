all spoiled.
wet.
in her toy box.
on the stain bottle.
wet and dirty.
in charge of the signals.
too high for him to reach.
scared.
lower.
in the bottle.
broken.
doing this.
dirty.
dry.
different.
in the bag.
still open.
dry and warm.
lying.
not as nice as before.
broken.
empty.
loose.
hidden.
in the pen.
still alive, but with a little bit of sturdier.
on the top shelf.
all over the park.
no more.
lower.
dirty.
not on.
closed.
still quiet.
dirty.
lower.
in her garden.
sitting on the skateboard.
full of yummy pizza pieces.
easy.
wet and dirty.
still fresh.
dry.
broken.
safe.
not working.
sour.
in the garden.
still hot.
not ready yet.
