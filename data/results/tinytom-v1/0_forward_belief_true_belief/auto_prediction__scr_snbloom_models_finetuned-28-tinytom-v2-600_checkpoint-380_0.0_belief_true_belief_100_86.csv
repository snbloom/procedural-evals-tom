in the sand.
delaying the train.
changed.
hidden.
destroyed.
lower.
in her garden.
melting.
in the tunnel.
gone.
about the history of the city.
messy.
playing on the slide.
on.
empty.
flying in the air.
scratched.
in a different room.
missing.
in a different room.
squished.
not safe.
chewed.
inside the wardrobe.
shaking.
broken.
in the box.
not strong and safe.
dancing on the page of her book.
shaking.
broken.
lying on the grass.
dirty.
straight.
dry.
not hot at all.
open.
untied.
wet.
dirty.
wet.
in a different place.
her holiday dates.
damaged on its first date.
securely fastened.
full of dirt.
on the peanuts.
on the stand.
polluted.
twisted.
flat.
unzip.
clean.
wobbling.
in the cave.
in the tree.
on the jail.
uneven.
sealed.
in her bag.
wet and plain.
a playful squirrel).
changing shape.
standing.
cheap.
in the sun.
rough.
old and worn out.
dry.
hurt.
closed.
empty.
unraveling.
open and easy to walk in.
caught by the fishermen.
in a mess.
scratched.
untwisted.
dancing.
hiding in a tree.
all thick and sticky.
melting.
dirty.
untwisted.
bent.
too expensive.
