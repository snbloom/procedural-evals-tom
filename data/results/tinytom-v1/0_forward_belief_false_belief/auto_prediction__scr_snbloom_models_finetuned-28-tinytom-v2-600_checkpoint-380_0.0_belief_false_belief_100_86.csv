in the sand.
delaying the train.
different.
under the sand.
destroyed.
lower.
in the garden.
dry.
under the ground.
on.
about the history of the jazz club.
messy.
playing a game of fetch.
covered in frosting.
empty.
flying so high.
new and shiny.
in a different room.
set for a game.
under control of the chocolate.
squished.
not safe.
chewed.
under the bed.
leaning.
broken.
in the box.
not strong.
sitting on the page.
shaking.
on the tree.
missing.
dirty.
straight.
dry.
not hot.
closed.
neat.
wet.
clean.
dry.
on the sand.
missing.
clean and ready to play.
securely fastened.
full of dirt.
dry.
on the stand.
clean.
straight.
flat.
unzip.
clean.
shaking.
in the cave.
in the tree.
on top of the park.
damaged.
sealed.
in her bag.
wet.
at home.
changing.
standing on the field.
cheap.
too hot.
smooth and smooth.
still as good as before.
dry.
hurt.
closed.
empty.
under the paper.
closed.
in the different boat.
in the pretty house.
shiny and perfect.
in the city.
still dancing.
hiding in the tree.
full.
melting.
dirty.
still tangled.
too stiff to sit on the chair.
in the store.
