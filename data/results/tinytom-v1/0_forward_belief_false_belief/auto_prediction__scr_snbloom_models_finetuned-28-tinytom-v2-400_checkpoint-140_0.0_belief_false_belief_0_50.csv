spoiled.
wet.
in her toy box.
on the stain.
wet and dirty.
delayed.
on the top shelf.
deaf.
lower.
sour.
broken.
under the vine.
dirty.
salty.
on the clock.
in his bag.
still open.
dry and hot.
lying.
not as nice as his dog's.
cracked.
empty.
loose.
under the sand.
in the pen.
destroyed.
on the top shelf.
still in the box.
still alive.
higher.
dirty.
late.
closed.
still playing.
dirty.
lower.
on the ground.
sitting on the skateboard.
safe.
easy.
wet and clean.
still fresh.
dry.
broken.
safe.
still quiet.
sour.
still standing.
still hot.
not ready.
