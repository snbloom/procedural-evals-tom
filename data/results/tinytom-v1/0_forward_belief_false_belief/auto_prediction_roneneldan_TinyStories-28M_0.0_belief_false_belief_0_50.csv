a gift for her brother.
not good anymore.

too high.
"the best thing ever!

broken.
so pretty now that the gardener was spraying it.
ruined.
spoiled.

so powerful and so beautiful.
very special and important.
angry.
too dangerous to touch.
so old and broken now.
empty.
not a good friend.
very special.
lost.
the best toy ever.
too heavy for her to carry.
ruined.
not so good anymore.
too high.
not clean anymore.
broken.
safe now.
too strong for her.
still yummy.
not fair.
very tasty.
not so fun anymore.
safe now.
too easy.
not safe.
spoiled.
too dry.
broken and she is sad.
not safe.
