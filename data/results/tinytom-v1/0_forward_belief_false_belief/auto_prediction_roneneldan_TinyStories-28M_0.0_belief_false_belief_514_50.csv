broken, so she quickly put it away.
too messy, so he just smiles and keeps playing.
too cold.
too heavy for him to pull.
sad.
too heavy for her to play with.
too hot, so he quickly grabbed a towel and put the eggs in the pan.
too small for her.
so special, she will never forget it.
too dangerous.
full of treats, so she quickly unwrapped her book and began to read.
too dirty and she needs to clean it.
too strong for him to share.
too salty for the tea.
a bad place to water her plants.
too small and she is sad.
a special rock.
broken, so she is sad.
very important.
gone forever.
so cool.
so much fun to play with.
very special and important.
broken, but he still wants to snap a picture.
too strong for him.
too tall to reach! She carefully picked it up and put it in her pocket.
too yummy and she wants to try it.
lost forever.
too messy.
ruined.
broken.
not safe for her to climb.
going to fall into the lake.
too special to keep.
empty.
ruined.
gone.
very special.
not safe.
broken.
very friendly and he smiles at it.
too precious to keep.
too heavy for her to carry.
gone.
not safe.
too big and might break.
too hot, so he decides to take it off.
deaf.
the best friend ever.
