unlocked.
weakened.
lighter.
ruined.
still full, not realizing that his sister had taken some.
in the lost and found box.
no longer full of healthy mints, but rather, mints that have been nibbled on by.
becoming more concealed and private.
no longer fresh.
now ready for him to paint his giant tree on.
broken.
incorrect.
not as hard as she thought.
ruined and the man might not want it anymore.
now affordable.
no longer sharp.
no longer straight.
on the floor.
scared of the birds.
still fully charged.
empty.
no longer as shiny and clean as it once was.
scared of the kitty.
now light enough for his dog to fetch.
now dirty again.
no longer usable.
no longer undisturbed and perfect for her search.
still raw and needs more heat to cook properly.
transforming into ice cream because of the special ingredient the staff added.
dirty.
no longer synchronized with the school's main clock.
dull.
the perfect audience for his song.
always well-maintained.
no longer opaque, but now transparent.
broken.
open.
now wet.
melting.
closed.
now loose.
alive and playing along with him.
still light, as he was unaware of the swap.
not as bouncy as before.
broken.
no longer cold and conductive.
not twisted tight anymore.
now empty.
ruined.
now perfect for building his dream sandcastle.
