locked.
not strong.
not as heavy as before.
unwrapped.
full of squiggly things.
in the box.
full of the mints.
a sign of the chance.
still fresh and yummy.
filled with air.
not working.
short and unruly.
hard.
still in the market.
too expensive.
sharp.
old and funny.
on the top shelf.
hiding.
not charged.
full.
dirty.
in its hole.
not as strong as before.
clean and ready to be used.
full of it.
messy.
not cooked.
now melting.
dirty.
the same as the one on the big clock.
not sharp.
quiet and tired.
in good shape.
cool.
working.
open.
wet and dirty.
melting.
closed.
untied.
folded on the bench.
lighter.
bouncing.
tight and good for rolling.
in the cold room.
twisted.
full of crayons.
old and weak.
dry and hard.
