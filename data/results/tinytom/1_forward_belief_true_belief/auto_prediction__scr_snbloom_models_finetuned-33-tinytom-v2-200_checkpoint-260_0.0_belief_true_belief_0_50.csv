more than just room.
weak.
not going to take it any longer.
under the gift.
full.
in the box.
full of fat, healthy mints.
full of leaves.
fresh and yummy.
full.
not working.
infectious and the Earth is still busy focusing on the spaceship's launch.
easy.
not worth the money.
very expensive.
not as dull as it used to be.
crooked.
down.
not safe.
empty.
full.
cleaner than the toy one.
shy.
not dry.
dirty and not shiny.
the perfect size for his drawing.
not as clean as she is.
not cooked enough.
full of magic.
dirty.
unplugging.
not as important as the veggies on the table.
peaceful and inviting.
the right size.
too plain and bright.
working.
not closed.
wet and dirty.
melting.
locked.
untied.
still folded.
different.
not as bouncy as before.
not tight enough.
still cold.
not as tight as before.
full of jolly colors.
more valuable than any other toy.
softer than a cloud.
