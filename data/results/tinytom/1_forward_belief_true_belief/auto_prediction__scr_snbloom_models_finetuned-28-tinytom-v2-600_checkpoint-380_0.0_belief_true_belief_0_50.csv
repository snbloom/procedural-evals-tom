locked.
weak.
heavier than the fish.
unwrapped.
full.
in the box.
full of yummy, healthy mints.
spreading.
wasted.
filled with air.
in a hurry.
slightly different.
hard.
expensive.
expensive.
sharp.
old.
on the top shelf.
hiding.
fully charged.
spilling.
dirty.
hiding in the hole.
not as strong as he is.
dirty.
full.
messy.
not cooked.
now thick and creamy.
dirty.
disconnected.
ready to chop.
quiet and restful.
in good shape.
very plain.
broken.
open.
wet and dirty.
melting.
closed.
untied.
folded on the bench.
lighter.
bouncing so high.
not tight anymore.
in the cold.
twisted.
full of so many colors.
old and weak.
becoming so dry and hard.
