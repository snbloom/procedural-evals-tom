locked.
not strong.
being used as a fishing line.
unwrapped.
full.
in the box.
full of yummy, healthy mints.
spreading.
wasted.
filled with air.
in a hurry.
off by the force force.
hard.
expensive.
expensive.
sharp.
old and curved.
on the top shelf.
hiding.
charged.
full.
dirty.
hiding in the hole.
not as strong as before.
dirty.
not full.
messy.
not cooked.
now thick and creamy.
dirty.
disconnected.
not used to chop veggies.
wiggly and tired.
in good shape.
very plain.
broken.
open.
wet and dirty.
melting.
closed.
untied.
folded on the bench.
lighter.
bouncing.
not tight anymore.
in the cold.
twisted.
full of crayons.
old and weak.
dry and hard.
