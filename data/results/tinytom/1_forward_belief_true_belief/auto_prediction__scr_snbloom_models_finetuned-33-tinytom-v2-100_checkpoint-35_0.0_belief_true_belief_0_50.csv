locked.
weak.
not so bad.
wrapped in a shiny paper.
full of yummy pasta.
in the box.
full of healthy, healthy mints.
a secret spot.
yummy.
not empty.
not working.
not as clear as the network belt.
hard.
very expensive.
very expensive.
not sharp enough.
round and round.
on the top shelf.
gone now.
still in power.
full.
not clean, but he believes his toy lizard is clean.
safe and she believes the rat is safe.
dry.
dirty and needs to be cleaned.
spinning of ink.
cool.
still warm.
melting.
clean.
not a good place for a project.
not as important as the carrots.
peaceful and quiet.
very flexible.
amazing.
working.
open.
wet and dirty.
melting.
open.
untied.
very special.
the best way to show it is Friday.
still bouncing.
too tight.
very cool.
not tight.
full of crayons.
too heavy for the doggie.
soft and fluffy.
