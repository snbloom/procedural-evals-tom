locked.
not strong.
not as heavy as before.
wrapped in a funny paper.
full of squiggly things.
in the box.
full of the mints.
a sign of his parrot's misbehaviour.
empty.
empty.
not working anymore.
not working properly.
easy.
still in the market.
very expensive.
not sharp at all.
not so flat anymore.
on the top shelf.
hiding.
not working.
full.
dirty.
in its hole.
not as strong as the stick.
clean and ready to be polished.
filled with a little bit of brown ink.
messy.
not ready.
turning into a cold, sweet treat.
dirty.
the same clock on the big clock.
not ready to be used.
quiet and tired.
neat and tidy.
cool.
working.
open.
wet and dirty.
melting.
closed.
untied.
folded up.
lighter.
bouncing too high.
tight and tight.
in the cold room.
twisted.
full of all the colors.
not strong anymore.
dry.
