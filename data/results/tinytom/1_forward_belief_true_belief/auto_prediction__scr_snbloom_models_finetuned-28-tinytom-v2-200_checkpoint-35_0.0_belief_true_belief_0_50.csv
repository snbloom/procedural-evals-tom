weak.
not as heavy as the fish on the scale.
wrapped in a shiny paper.
full of yummy food.
in the box.
full of healthy mints.
a sign of a new, clear day.
not fresh.
empty.
not working properly.
not so reliable.
hard.
very expensive.
not expensive.
dull.
not broken.
on the top shelf.
so fast.
not working.
full.
not clean.
in its hole.
not as light as the stick.
clean and ready to be polished.
full.
cool and relaxing.
not ready.
melting.
clean.
the same clock on the big clock.
not ready to be used.
peaceful and quiet.
perfect for the train.
cool.
working.
open.
wet.
melting.
closed.
not tied tight.
a fun toy.
not light.
bouncing too high.
tight and tight.
cold.
twisted.
full of all the colors.
weak.
dry.
