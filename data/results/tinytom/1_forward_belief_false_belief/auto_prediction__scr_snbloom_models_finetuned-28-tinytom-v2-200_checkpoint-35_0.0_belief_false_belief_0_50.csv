locked.
weak.
not as heavy as the fish on the scale.
wrapped in a shiny paper.
full of yummy food.
in the box.
full of healthy, healthy mints.
not a good spot.
not fresh.
empty.
working fine.
not as cool as he is.
hard.
very expensive.
not as pretty as the painting at the mall.
dull.
not broken.
on the top shelf.
hiding in the bushes.
not as good as before.
full.
clean and shiny.
in its hole.
not as strong as the stick.
clean and ready to be polished.
full.
cool and relaxing.
not cooked yet.
melting.
clean.
the same clock on the big clock.
sharp.
quiet and still.
still standing.
just right.
working.
open.
dry and clean.
melting.
closed.
not tied up.
still on the bench.
light.
bouncing too high.
tight and tight.
cold.
twisted.
full of all the colors.
weak.
dry and hard.
