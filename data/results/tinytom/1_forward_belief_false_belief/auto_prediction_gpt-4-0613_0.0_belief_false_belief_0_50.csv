still locked.
still strong.
still as heavy as before.
still wrapped in the shiny paper.
still full.
still in her bag.
still full of healthy mints.
still clear and open.
still fresh and yummy.
still empty.
still working fine.
still synchronized with Earth's rotation.
still unsolved.
still good, despite the smudge.
still very expensive.
still sharp.
still straight and flat.
still on the top shelf.
still there.
still fully charged and ready to go.
still full.
still as clean and shiny as the day he got it.
still hiding in its hole, unaware that it had been scared away by the kitty.
still as heavy as it was when he first saw it.
still clean and ready for decoration.
still full of wet, usable ink.
still cool and undisturbed, unaware of the chaos the children have caused.
still cooking, but in reality, it's starting to cool down.
still thick and creamy.
still clean.
still showing the correct time.
still sharp and ready to use.
still as peaceful as ever, undisturbed by the playful ducks.
always straight and aligned.
still opaque.
broken.
still closed.
still dry and clean.
still solid.
still open.
still tied tightly.
still neatly folded on the bench, just as he left it.
still light.
not as bouncy as before.
still in perfect condition for her big idea.
still cold because she wrapped it around the ice.
still twisted tight.
still full.
still as strong as before.
still as hard and dense as it was in the morning.
