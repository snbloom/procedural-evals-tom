locked.
weak.
lighter.
wrapped in a shiny paper.
full of squiggly things.
in the box.
full of the mints.
not working.
still fresh and yummy.
filled with air.
not working.
over.
hard.
still in the market.
not expensive.
sharp.
upside down.
on the top shelf.
hiding in the forest.
not charged.
spilling out.
dirty.
in its hole.
not as strong as before.
clean and ready to be polished.
full of it.
dry and sandy.
not cooked.
thick and creamy.
clean.
the same as the one on the big clock.
sharp.
quiet and tired.
in the big station.
smooth.
working.
closed.
wet and dirty.
melting.
closed.
untied.
folded.
lighter.
bouncing on the playground.
tight and good for rolling.
in the cold room.
twisted.
full of all the colors.
not as strong as before.
all soft and squishy.
