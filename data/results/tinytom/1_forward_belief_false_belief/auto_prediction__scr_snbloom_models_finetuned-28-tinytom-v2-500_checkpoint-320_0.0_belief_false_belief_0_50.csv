locked.
strong.
lighter.
wrapped in sparkly paper.
full.
in the box.
full of yummy, healthy mints.
not.
fresh and yummy.
full of air.
working fine.
off by the launch.
hard.
wasted.
expensive.
sharp.
flat.
on the top shelf.
hiding.
not charged.
full.
dirty.
in its hole.
lying on the ground.
clean and ready for decoration.
full.
cool.
not cooked yet.
thick and creamy.
clean.
the same clock on the wall.
sharp and ready to chop veggies.
quiet and restful.
in the big station.
in the sun.
working.
closed.
wet and dirty.
dull.
open.
tied tight.
neatly folded on the bench.
lighter.
bouncing.
made of tight wheels.
in the cold.
twisted.
full of all the colors.
not as strong as before.
dry and hard.
