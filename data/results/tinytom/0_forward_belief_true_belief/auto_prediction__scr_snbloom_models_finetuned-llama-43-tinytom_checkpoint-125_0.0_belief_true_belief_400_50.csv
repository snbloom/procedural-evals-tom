hurt.
empty.
too old and weak.
not smooth anymore.
safe to use.
ready to zoom.
broken.
too tight.
too high.
smooth and smooth.
wet and ready to be thrown.
so clean and beautiful.
dirty.
in the same direction as her puppy.
very active.
so lovely.
open.
too hot and not cooked.
very special.
strong and strong.
gone.
closed.
in the closet.
broken.
stuck in the net.
fake.
very dirty.
full of water.
still full.
not tidy.
too small and weak.
perfect.
broken.
not dry anymore.
so soft and shiny.
that the dog is hiding there! Amy runs to the tree and sees the dog.
full of hot dogs.
broken.
twisted and knotted.
not smooth anymore.
too big for the little puppy.
still twisted.
dancing in the sky.
scared.
wet.
too thick.
not safe.
wet.
broken.
to be naughty.
