locked.
weak.
very heavy.
wrapped in a silly way.
too small for her to play with.
in the box.
empty.
a secret.
not as tasty as he thought.
full of air.
all wet.
a bit boring.
a puzzle of a puzzle.
smelly.
broken.
not sharp enough.
dry.
a different one.
gone forever.
not working.
spilled.
so dirty that he doesn't see the toy lizard's dirty spot.
scared.
dry.
so shiny and clean.
the same as a pebble.
messy.
burning.
frozen.
full.
not working.
not sharp anymore.
peaceful.
not as good as before.
shiny and smooth.
broken.
open.
wet.
melting.
open.
loose.
dancing in the wind.
heavier than the old piano in the playground.
broken.
not as good as the dog's cart.
cold.
too tight.
all over the ground.
broken.
drying.
