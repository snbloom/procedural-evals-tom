locked.
not strong.
not moving properly.
opened by the cousin's sneaky trick.
full of squiggly things.
in the box.
empty.
spreading.
empty.
filled with air.
not working.
not working properly.
not so hard.
still in the market.
on sale.
dull.
old and worn out.
on the top shelf.
so quiet.
off.
not watering.
not as clean as his friend's.
hiding in the hole.
dry.
dirty.
on his table.
dirty.
not cooked.
now melting.
dirty.
the same as the one on the big clock.
not sharp.
a little wobbly.
all neat and tidy.
now turned into a puddle.
broken.
open.
wet.
melting.
closed.
untied.
dancing.
lighter.
bouncing too high.
still in good shape.
in the cold room.
twisted.
full of crayons.
old and weak.
dry and hard.
