locked.
not as strong as his kite's string.
being greedy.
ruined.
a big, wiggly box.
in the box.
empty.
a sign of his parrot being a smart and clever parrot.
empty.
filled with air.
not ready to sing anymore.
not as good as his own.
not so hard.
still in the market.
not on the wall.
dull.
too small.
lost.
so clever.
not working.
not very clean.
not clean.
scared.
dry.
clean and ready to be polished.
not on his table.
dirty.
not ready to eat.
making the ice cream melt.
not clean.
the same clock that is the same one.
not sharp enough to cut the vegetables.
a safe place for the ducks to rest.
very tidy.
made of a special material that no one else has.
broken.
open.
not dry.
melting.
safe and secure.
loose.
dancing.
not as light as the new one.
bouncing too high.
not as fast as the toy cart.
warm.
too tight.
broken.
weak and weak.
getting softer and lighter.
