locked.
not strong.
being greedy.
unwrapped.
full of squiggly things.
in the box.
full of the yummy mints.
spreading.
wasted.
filled with air.
in a hurry.
not working properly.
incomplete.
wasted.
on sale.
sharp.
old and worn out.
on the top shelf.
hiding.
charged.
wet.
dirty.
hiding in the cat's hole.
dry.
dirty.
not on his table.
dirty.
not cooked yet.
now cold.
dirty.
disconnected.
dull.
wiggly.
all good.
very light.
broken.
open.
wet and dirty.
melting.
closed.
loose.
dancing.
heavier.
bouncing.
damaged.
in the cold room.
twisted.
full of crayons.
old and weak.
dry and hard.
