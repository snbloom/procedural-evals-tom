locked.
not strong enough.
not as fat as the fish on the fish's scale.
not real.
full of yummy food.
in the box.
full of the mints.
a sign of the new park.
not for the squirrel.
filled with air.
not ready to sing anymore.
not as good as the first one.
not so hard.
still in the market.
not finished.
dull.
not so fun anymore.
on the top shelf.
so fast and so high.
not working.
not clean.
not clean.
scared.
dry.
not clean.
not full.
so soft and smooth.
still burning.
melting.
not clean.
the same clock that he used to watch his favorite show.
not good.
so peaceful.
very nice.
so cool.
broken.
open.
wet.
melting.
safe.
not tied properly.
dancing.
not as light as the old one.
bouncing too high.
broken.
warm.
not so tight.
full of crayons.
still as strong as before.
dry.
