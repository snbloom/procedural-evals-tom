locked.
not as strong as his kite.
being caught.
spoiled.
full of squiggly things.
in the box.
empty.
a sign of his feathered friend.
empty.
filled with air.
not ready to sing anymore.
not as good as the one at the space station.
not so hard.
still in the market.
on sale.
dull.
not so big anymore.
on the very top shelf.
so quiet.
not working.
not watering.
not clean anymore.
hiding in a corner.
dry.
clean and ready to be polished.
not on his table.
dirty.
not ready.
making the cold treat.
dirty.
the same clock that he was working on.
not sharp.
a little bit wobbly.
neat and tidy.
not as strong as the day before.
making the coffee machine stop working.
open.
wet.
melting.
closed.
loose.
dancing.
heavier.
bouncing too high.
still okay.
wrapped up.
too tight.
full of crayons.
not as strong as his own magnet.
dry.
