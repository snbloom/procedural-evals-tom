hurt.
full of sand.
broken.
sticky.
wet.
tired.
flat.
wiggly.
too high to get.
smooth.
wet.
messy.
dirty.
running out of time.
sleepy.
soft and wiggly.
loose.
still raw.
stretched.
weak.
on the shelf.
open.
hiding in the closet.
broken.
in the net.
not real.
old and gross.
full of wet clothes.
empty.
in a mess.
stretched and wiggly.
scratched.
broken.
wilted.
soft and wobbly.
where she found the tree.
full of hot dogs.
not charged.
twisted.
smooth and not scratched.
dirty.
twisted in a fun way.
dancing.
hiding in the hole.
wet and squishy.
thick and sticky.
safe to play with.
wet.
in the box.
not valid.
