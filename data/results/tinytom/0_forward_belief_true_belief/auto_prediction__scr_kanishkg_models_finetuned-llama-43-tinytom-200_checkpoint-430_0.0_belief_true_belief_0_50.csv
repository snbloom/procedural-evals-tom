locked.
weak.
very heavy.
wrapped in a pretty paper.
empty.
in the box.
empty.
now a tiny bud.
not as tasty as he thought.
full of air.
all wet.
a little bit boring.
not so hard after all.
smelly.
now low.
dull because it doesn't cut the veggies.
dry.
a different color.
gone.
not working.
wet.
not clean anymore.
scared.
dry.
dirty.
the sun's warmth.
messy.
burning.
frozen.
full of yucky water.
not working.
tired.
quiet.
not as good as before.
not shiny anymore.
not working.
open.
wet and dirty.
all melted.
open.
loose.
dancing in the wind.
heavier than before.
squished.
not as good as the wheel on her cart.
cold.
uncomfortable.
all over the ground.
not as strong as before.
drying.
