locked.
not as strong as his kite.
not as strong as before.
not opened.
full of yummy food.
in the box.
empty.
a sign of his feathered friend.
empty.
filled with air.
not ready to sing anymore.
not as good as the one at the space station.
not so hard.
still in the market.
not on.
not sharp enough to cut the tomato.
not so big anymore.
on the top shelf.
so quiet and still.
not working anymore.
not watering.
not as clean as his real pet.
scared.
dry.
clean and ready to be polished.
not on his table.
soft and smooth.
still ready.
making the cold treat extra yummy.
not clean.
the same as the one in the school clock.
not sharp.
a safe place for the ducks to rest.
all neat and tidy.
very cool.
making the coffee machine work.
open.
not dry anymore.
melting.
safe and secure.
not tight anymore.
dancing.
not as light as the old one.
bouncing too high.
still safe and tight.
wrapped up.
too tight.
full of crayons.
still strong and not as strong as before.
dry.
