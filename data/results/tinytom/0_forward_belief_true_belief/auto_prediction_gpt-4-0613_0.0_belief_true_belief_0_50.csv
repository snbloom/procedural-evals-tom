being opened by a monster, as she was not aware that her baby brother had found the extra key.
weakening.
lighter than before.
ruined.
still full enough for his lunch, so he just smiles at his sister's mischief and continues chopping his.
lost.
no longer safe in the park.
becoming a perfect stage for his parrot to perform its new trick.
no longer safe from the cheeky squirrel.
perfect for his painting.

no longer hard.

no longer useful for chopping.
playing tricks on her.
now within her reach.
the one he has been looking for.

now empty.

magical.

becoming untied.

magical.
ruined.
broken.
conducting heat from the room.
like the game twist-the-bottle she wants to play with her friends.
ruined.
ruined.
