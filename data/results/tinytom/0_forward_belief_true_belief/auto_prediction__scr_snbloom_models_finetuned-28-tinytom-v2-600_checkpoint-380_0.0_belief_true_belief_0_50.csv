locked.
not strong.
being greedy.
unwrapped.
full of squiggly pasta.
in the box.
full of the yummy mints.
spreading.
wasted.
filled with air.
making the microphone noisy.
not working properly.
incomplete.
wasted.
on sale.
sharp.
old.
on the top shelf.
hiding.
charged.
spilled.
dirty.
hiding in the hole.
dry.
dirty.
not on his table.
dirty.
missing.
now frozen.
dirty.
disconnected.
sharp.
wiggly.
all good.
missing.
on.
open.
wet and dirty.
melting.
closed.
loose.
blowing away.
heavier.
bouncing so high.
wobbling.
in the cold room.
twisted.
full of crayons.
old and weak.
dry and hard.
