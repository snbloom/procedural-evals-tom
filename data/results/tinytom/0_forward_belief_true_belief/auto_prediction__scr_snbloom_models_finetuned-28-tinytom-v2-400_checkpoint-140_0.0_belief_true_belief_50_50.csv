not broken.
on the table.
bumping.
rough.
a little sad.
dirty.
knocked over.
dirty.
not allowed to play.
open.
still shining.
melting.
scattered.
when the squirrel steps on something soft, like a leaf or a rock.
when a funny-looking creature does not see Lucy pouring water into the pot.
a messy pile of sand.
lying on the ground.
in the box.
not strong.
not strong enough to catch a fish.
upside down.
now all squished and twisted.
dirty.
polluted.
dusty.
weak.
grey.
not neat and tidy.
not as good as the mouse's small one.
smelly.
loose.
now shorter and easier to find.
not hot.
missing.
full.
not supposed to be hit by the soccer ball.
lower.
scratched.
off.
the menu that is on the menu.
now the smallest piece of the football.
