locked.
not as strong as his kite.
not as strong as the fish on the fish.
ruined.
empty.
in the box.
empty.
a sign of his parrot's misbehaviour.
empty.
not as big as the big, colorful balloon.
not ready to sing anymore.
not as good as the one at the space station.
not so hard.
still in the market.
not on the wall.
dull.
old.
lost.
so quiet.
not working anymore.
not watering the airport.
not clean anymore.
scared.
not as strong as the stick.
clean and ready to be polished.
not on his table.
soft and smooth.
still burning.
making the cold treat.
dirty.
the same clock that he was working on.
not as good as the other knives.
a fun place to sing.
neat and tidy.
made of a special material that only appears in the sun.
making the coffee machine stop working.
open.
wet.
melting.
closed.
not tied properly.
dancing.
heavier.
bouncing too high.
still safe and tight.
wrapped up.
twisted.
empty.
still strong.
dry.
