hurt.
full.
tied to the branch.
not smooth anymore.
dripping.
tired.
flat and smooth.
untied.
too low.
bumpy.
wet and dry.
clean.
dirty and not shiny anymore.
working.
tired.
soft.
closed.
cooked.
not shiny anymore.
strong.
on a shelf.
open.
hiding in the closet.
broken.
in trouble.
fake.
not clean.
wet and sticky.
not working.
tidy.
stuck.
not perfect anymore.
broken.
dry and wilted.
soft and wobbly.
hidden.
full of hot dogs.
on its side.
untangled.
scratched.
clean.
untangled.
still in the air.
in the tree.
wet and dry.
thick and sticky.
not safe to play with.
wet and clean.
upside down.
over.
