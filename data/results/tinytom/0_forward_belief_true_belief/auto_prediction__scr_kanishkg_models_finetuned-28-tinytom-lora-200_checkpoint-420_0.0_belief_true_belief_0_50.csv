locked.
not as strong as his kite's string.
not as clean as the fish's.
ruined.
empty.
in the box.
empty.
a sign of the tree.
empty.
filled with air.
not ready to sing anymore.
not as good as his own.
not so hard.
still in the market.
too big.
dull.
too small.
lost.
too quiet.
not working.
full.
clean and shiny.
scared, and so does the rat.
not as light as a stick.
clean and ready to be polished.
on his table.
dirty.
not ready to cook.
made.
dirty.
the same as the one in the school.
not sharp enough to cut the vegetables.
a little shallow.
neat and tidy.
a big piece of light.
broken.
open.
wet and dirty.
melting.
closed.
loose.
dancing.
heavier.
bouncing.
made better than the cart's wheel.
warm.
twisted.
empty.
weak.
dry.
