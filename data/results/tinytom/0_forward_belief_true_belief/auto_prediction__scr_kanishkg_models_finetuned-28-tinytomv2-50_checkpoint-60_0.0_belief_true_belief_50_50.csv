eating.
not clean.
untied.
not in his room.
not flexible enough to hold the castle together.
full.
too small.
a fun toy.
empty.
not broken.
not on the table.
smooth.
smooth.
a flat spot.
dirty.
broken.
not yellow.
"not as fun as the ""lucky king."
open.
so soft and comfy.
melting.
making the bread crumbs dirty.
not a straight stick.
a big pot.
not as clean as the real cars.
gone.
in the box.
not strong anymore.
not strong enough.
broken.
not just soft, it is also tough.
dirty.
recorded by a man who is fishing.
covered in dust.
weak.
sad.
not as nice as before.
not as strong as the mouse's.
the ice cream truck's smell.
so tight and bouncy.
so much fun.
not cold.
still in the open air.
empty.
not as good as his dog's ball.
not as bouncy as the ball.
broken.
on the coffee shop.
not a good idea.
not as good as the big one.
