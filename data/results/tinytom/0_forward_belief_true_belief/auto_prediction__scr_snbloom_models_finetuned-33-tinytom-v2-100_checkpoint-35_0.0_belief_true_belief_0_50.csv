the only way to make her feel safe.
weak.
not going to take it away.
wrapped in sparkly paper.
full of yummy pasta.
in the box.
full of big, yummy mints.
a special place.
yummy.
not for painting.
broken.
not right.
a big puzzle.
very strong.
very special.
not sharp enough to cut the vegetables.
warm.
up there.
gone, maybe next time.
not working.
not there.
not as clean as the toy one is.
safe and she is happy to share her food with her little friend.
getting dry.
dirty and needs to be cleaned.
spinning of ink.
too messy.
still warm.
making the ice cream taste even better.
not clean.
not working.
not as important as the carrots.
a perfect place for the ducks to swim and quack.
very important.
too hot and cool for his friends.
broken.
shut tight.
wet.
melting.
open.
not working.
a funny shape.
the best way to show it is possible.
broken.
broken.
a good way to keep warm.
not tight.
a mess.
too heavy for the dog to chew.
soft and warm.
