locked.
not as strong as his kite.
not as heavy as before.
not opened.
empty.
in the box.
empty.
a sign of his feathered friend.
empty.
filled with air.
not working properly.
not as long as he has a chance to fly.
not finished.
still in the market.
on sale.
not sharp enough to cut the veggies.
not so shiny anymore.
on the top shelf.
very quiet.
not working anymore.
not watering the airport job.
clean and shiny.
scared.
dry.
clean and ready to be polished.
not on his table.
clean.
still burning.
the perfect temperature.
clean.
the same as the one in the school clock.
dull.
peaceful.
all tidy and neat.
not real.
working.
open.
dry.
melting.
safe.
loose.
in the middle of the fun game.
the perfect fit for his little toy.
bouncing too high.
still safe and tight.
in the cold room.
twisted.
full of them.
strong.
just as soft and warm as the sand.
