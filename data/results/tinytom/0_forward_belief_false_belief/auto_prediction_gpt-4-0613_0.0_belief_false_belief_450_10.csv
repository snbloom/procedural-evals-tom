magical because it opened on its own.
broken and feels very sad.
still fluttering around the flowers, unaware that it has gone to sleep.
deflated and feels very sad.
still solid.
dancing.
just being shy about playing on the swings.
punctured.
broken because she can no longer see her reflection clearly.
missing.
