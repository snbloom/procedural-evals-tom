still locked, unaware of her baby brother's mischief.
still strong.
still the same weight as before.
still safely wrapped and hidden away.
still full.
still in her bag.
still full and untouched.
still visible and clear.
still untouched.
already filled with air and ready for him to paint.
broken.
still on time.
magical because it was solved when she wasn't looking.
perfectly fine and decides to buy it.
too expensive.
still sharp.
still straight as a ruler.
still on the top shelf.
still there.
still charged and ready to play.
still full.
still as beautiful and exciting as the day he first got it.
simply not hungry or maybe feeling a bit shy today.
still heavy, just as it was when he first saw it.
still clean and ready for the stickers.
still full of wet, usable ink.
still perfect for her treasure hunt.
still cooking, but in reality, it's starting to cool down.
still in its liquid form.
still clean.
still correct.
still sharp and ready to use.
still as quiet as a whisper, and he begins to sing his song.
always perfect and well-maintained.
still as strong and opaque as before.
broken.
still closed.
still dry and clean.
a piece of art, a sculpture perhaps, left by a local artist.
still open and ready for him to enter.
still tightly secured.
still on the bench, waiting for the game to start.
still the old, light one.
broken and feels sad.
still in perfect condition.
getting warmer because it is absorbing the heat from the room.
still tightly twisted on.
still safe and secure next to him.
still in his pocket, safe and sound.
