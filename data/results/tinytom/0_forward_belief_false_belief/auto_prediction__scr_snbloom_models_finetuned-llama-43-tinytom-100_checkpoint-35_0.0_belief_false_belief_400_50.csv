too weak to walk.
too heavy for her to carry.
too strong for the squirrels.
ruined.
safe and fun.
too slow and too slow.
broken.
too tight.
too deep and he can't get his lunch.
so smooth and pretty.
wet and she laughs.
the best tree in the park.
gone forever.
trying to be a little bit louder than the noise.
very tired.
so lovely.
very special.
safe and warm.
for her friend.
so strong and beautiful.
gone forever.
too scary.
in trouble.
broken.
too small to swim.
fake and she will never find it.
very special and will be safe.
full of water.
still busy.
very special and she wants to keep it safe.
gone forever.
perfect and she is going to jump through it again.
broken.
going to die.
too weak to be made.
that, when she looks around, she sees the doggie! He has found the perfect hiding.
full of hot dogs.
gone forever.
too tight.
going to be a tasty snack.
full of food.
so beautiful, she just had to sell them.
dancing in the sky.
safe and he laughs.
too wet to play with.
too thick and too sticky.
safe.
so funny.
for her friend.
very naughty.
