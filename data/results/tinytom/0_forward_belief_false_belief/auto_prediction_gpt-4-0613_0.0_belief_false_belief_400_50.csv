just being stubborn and refuses to move.
empty because of some magic.
just moving on its own, as if by magic.
ruined.
still good to use.
still ready for their big adventure.
broken.
still securely attached to her.
magically growing on its own.
still smooth.
still dry.
dirty on its own.
still in her pocket.
not focusing on the training because he is not interested or maybe he is just being stubborn.
just naturally getting tired after a long day of playing and jumping around.
naturally wobbly.
magically unscrewing itself.
still cooking.
still in perfect condition.
not strong because it is wobbling.
broken.
still easy to navigate.
just playing hide and seek with her.
still in perfect condition.
disappearing mysteriously.
still her toy, but it's not.
still safe to touch.
just too full and that's why she can't find her toy.
broken.
still tidy and in its place.
still on her face.
still perfect.
broken.
thirsty and need water.
still strong and sturdy.
still perfect.
still full of hot dogs.
broken.
still straight and ready for a game of fetch.
still perfect, unaware of the little scratch it now has.
dirty because he spilled his food.
magically untangled by some unseen force.
flying on its own.
still playing around the tree.
still dry and light.
magical.
still safe and strong.
still shiny and clean.
still perfectly arranged inside the box.
still in order, so he continues to work diligently.
