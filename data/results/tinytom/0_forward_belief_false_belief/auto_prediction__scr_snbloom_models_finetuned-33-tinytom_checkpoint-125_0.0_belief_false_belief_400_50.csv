hurt.
full of sand.
tied to the branch.
smooth and not sticky.
safe.
ready for a fun adventure.
flat and smooth.
tight.
too low.
smooth.
dry and ready to play.
clean and safe.
shiny and sparkly.
working.
tired.
soft and wiggly.
loose.
still cooked.
shiny and sparkly.
strong.
on a shelf.
open.
hiding in the closet.
broken.
free.
fake.
clean and safe.
full of wet clothes.
working.
tidy.
stuck together.
perfect.
now broken.
dry and wilted.
soft and wobbly.
hidden.
full of hot dogs.
on the table.
untangled.
smooth and not rough.
clean and shiny.
untangled.
still in the air.
in the tree.
dry and light.
thick and sticky.
not wobbly.
wet and clean.
upside down.
torn up.
