stuck.
empty.
too strong for the squirrels.
ruined.
safe and fun.
too slow and too slow.
broken.
too tight.
too deep and he can't get his lunch.
smooth and smooth.
wet and she laughs.
so clean and beautiful.
gone forever.
too loud and she thinks he is too small.
sleeping.
so lovely.
too tight.
cooked and then it is gone.
for her friend.
strong and will make the caterpillar happy.
gone forever.
closed.
in trouble.
broken.
gone.
fake.
very special and safe.
full of water.
still busy.
broken.
gone forever.
perfect and she is going to jump through it.
broken.
going to die.
too soft and slippery.
that the doggie is so happy! He has found a lovely hiding spot.
full of hot dogs.
ready to go.
broken.
going to be bruised.
full of food.
still beautiful, but the puppy has made a big mess.
dancing in the sky.
safe and happy in the tree.
too wet to play with.
too thick.
safe.
so funny.
broken.
very naughty.
