locked.
not as strong as his kite.
not as fat as the fish on the fish stall.
not as special as his friend's.
full of yummy food.
in the box.
empty.
a sign of his new pet.
not for the squirrel.
filled with air.
not working properly.
not as good as the one he misses.
not so hard.
still in the market.
not in the big, bright store.
dull.
not so shiny anymore.
on the top shelf.
so quiet and still.
not working.
not clean.
not as clean as his real pet.
scared and wants to be alone.
dry.
so clean and ready to be polished.
not as beautiful as the one he left for his special day.
dirty.
still burning.
melting.
full of water.
the same clock that he was working on.
dull.
so peaceful and quiet.
all tidy and neat.
not real.
making the coffee machine work.
open.
wet.
melting.
safe.
not tied up.
a little bit too tight.
not as light as the old one.
still bouncing.
still in the park.
cold.
twisted.
full of them.
not as strong as his own magnet.
dry.
