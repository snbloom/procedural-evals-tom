broken.
still on time.
still unsolved.
perfect for his mom.
too expensive for him to afford.
still sharp and continues to chop the veggies.
still straight.
still on the top shelf.
still there.
still charged and ready to play.
still full.
still as shiny and new as the day he got it.
scared of her today.
still heavy.
still clean and ready for the stickers.
still full of wet, usable ink.
hiding treasures waiting to be discovered.
still cooking.
magically turning into ice cream on its own.
clean and ready for him to wash his hands.
still correct.
still sharp and ready to use.
his audience, listening attentively to his song.
always in perfect condition.
still as strong and opaque as before.
broken.
still closed.
still dry and clean.
a piece of art, a sculpture perhaps, left by a local artist.
still open and ready for him to enter.
still tightly secured.
still on the bench, waiting for the game to start.
still the old, light one.
not as bouncy as before.
still in perfect condition.
getting warm because it is absorbing the heat from the room.
still tightly twisted on.
still safe and secure next to him.
still as strong as before.
