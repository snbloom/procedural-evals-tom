stuck.
empty.
too strong for the squirrels.
ruined.
safe to use.
ready to zoom.
flat.
too tight.
too deep.
smooth and smooth.
wet and ready to play.
clean and neat.
dirty.
in the air.
sleepy.
so lovely.
open.
cooked.
not as shiny as the puppy's gift.
strong and beautiful.
gone.
closed.
hiding in the closet.
broken.
safe.
fake.
not safe anymore.
full of water.
still full.
still neat and tidy.
gone forever.
perfect.
broken.
dry and thirsty.
too soft and slippery.
that the dog is looking for something to bury.
full of hot dogs.
ready to go.
twisted and knotted.
smooth and perfect.
full of food.
still twisted.
dancing in the sky.
safe in the tree.
wet.
too thick.
safe.
wet and slippery.
all messy.
to be naughty.
