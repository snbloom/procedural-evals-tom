locked.
not strong.
lighter.
wrapped in sparkly paper.
full.
in the box.
full of the yummy mints.
not.
empty.
full of air.
in the fun party.
off in the distance.
incomplete.
in the market.
on sale.
sharp.
still standing.
on the top shelf.
quiet.
in control.
full.
missing.
hiding in its hole.
dry.
clean and ready to be picked.
not on his table.
shiny and cool.
half-cut.
in the teeter-totper.
clean.
the same clock on the big clock.
dull.
calm.
all good.
dull.
working.
closed.
wet and dirty.
melting.
closed.
tied up.
sitting on the bench.
lighter.
bouncing.
still standing.
in the cold room.
twisted.
full of crayons.
not usable.
dry and hard.
