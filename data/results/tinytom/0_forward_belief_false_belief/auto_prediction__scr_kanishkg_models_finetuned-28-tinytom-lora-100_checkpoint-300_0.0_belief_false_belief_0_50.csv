locked.
not as strong as his kite's string.
not as fat as the first one.
not opened.
empty.
in the box.
empty.
a sign of the activity.
the squirrel's food.
filled with air.
not ready to sing anymore.
very important.
not so hard.
still in the market.
not on.
dull.
not so wobbly anymore.
lost in the library.
a sign of the forest.
not working.
spilling out of his book.
not dirty.
scared.
dry.
clean and ready to be polished.
on his table.
dirty.
still not ready to eat.
going to make the cold treat.
not clean.
the same as the one that the big one was at the school.
dull.
peaceful and quiet.
very tidy.
not real.
broken.
open.
not clean.
melting.
safe and secure.
loose.
dancing in the wind.
the best one in the school.
bouncing too high.
still the same cart.
warm.
twisted.
empty.
weak.
not getting soft.
