locked.
not strong.
not moving properly.
inside the present.
full of squiggly things.
in the box.
empty.
a sign of life.
still on the bench.
filled with air.
still in the bathroom.
not as long as he lives.
not finished.
still in the market.
on sale.
sharp.
not so funny anymore.
on the top shelf.
quiet and hidden.
off.
not watering the airport.
dirty.
hiding in the hole.
dry.
clean and ready to be polished.
on his table.
dirty.
not cooked.
 Yara believes the ice cream in the teacup is in the teacup.
clean.
the same as the one in the school clock.
dull.
quiet.
all neat and tidy.
not real.
on.
open.
wet.
melting.
closed.
untied.
still on the bench.
lighter.
bouncing on the boy's foot.
still standing.
in the warm room.
twisted.
full of crayons.
old and weak.
dry and hard.
