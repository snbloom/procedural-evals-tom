locked.
weak.
taking the wrong amount of time.
wrapped in a pretty paper.
almost full.
in the box.
empty.
a strong, straight branch.
empty.
full of gray paint.
all wet.
a little bit boring.
still hard.
all smudged.
still on.
dull.
all snug and secure.
a different color.
gone.
not working.
empty.
dirty.
in a hurry.
dry.
dirty.
the best color.
all messy.
burning.
frozen.
full of yucky water.
all wrinkled and uncomfortable.
tired.
quiet.
not straight.
shiny and clean.
not working.
open.
wet.
now all melted and sticky.
open.
loose.
dancing in the wind.
now complete.
squished.
not as good as the dog's cart.
too cold.
uncomfortable.
all over.
not as strong as before.
drying up.
