locked.
not as strong as his kite.
not as fat as before.
not opened.
empty.
in the box.
empty.
not working.
empty.
filled with air.
not working properly.
not as long as the space system is.
not so hard.
still in the market.
on the big, bright sign.
dull.
not broken.
on the top shelf.
so quiet and still.
not working anymore.
not watering the airport job.
dirty.
scared.
not as strong as the stick.
clean and ready to be polished.
not as shiny as usual.
dirty.
still burning.
the same flavor as the ice cream at the big factory.
dirty.
the same clock that he was working on.
dull.
peaceful.
all tidy and neat.
not real.
making the loud noise.
open.
wet.
melting.
closed.
tied to her kite.
still on the bench.
lighter.
bouncing too high.
still safe and tight.
cold.
twisted.
empty.
weak.
dry.
