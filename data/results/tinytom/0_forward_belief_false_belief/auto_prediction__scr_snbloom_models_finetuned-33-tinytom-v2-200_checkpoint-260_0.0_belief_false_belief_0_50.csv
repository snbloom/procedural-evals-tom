 Dora believes the book is high.
a big, shiny camera.
more than just fun.
on its way.
cleaner than the toy one.

full of clean water.
plugged in.
not as shiny as before.
very peaceful and quiet.
very important.

working.
shut.
dry and clean.
melting.
cozy and warm.

very bouncy.
very close to her.
still on the table.
very untidy.
full.
very strong.
dry and hard.
