locked.
not as strong as his kite's string.
not as clean as the fish's.
dirty.
empty.
in the box.
empty.
a sign of the activity.
still on the bench.
filled with air.
not working well.
not as long as he has learned to do his job.
not so hard.
gone.
on the other side.
sharp.
not so big.
on the top shelf.
playing hide and seek.
not working.
spilling out.
dirty.
scared.
dry.
clean and ready to be polished.
on his table.
dirty.
not ready to eat.
the cold mix.
dirty.
the same as the one in the school clock.
dull.
peaceful.
all neat and tidy.
not real.
broken.
open.
wet and dirty.
melting.
closed.
loose.
dancing.
the best one.
bouncing on the boy's boot.
too tight.
warm.
twisted.
empty.
weak.
too hard and tight.
