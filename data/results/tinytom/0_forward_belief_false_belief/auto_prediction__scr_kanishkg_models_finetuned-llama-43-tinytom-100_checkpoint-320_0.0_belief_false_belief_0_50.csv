locked.
weak.
very sad.
wrapped in a silly way.
almost full.
in the box.
empty.
a strong, deep branch.
empty.
full of gray paint.
all wet.
a bit boring.
a reminder of the fun day at the park.
smelly.
broken.
not sharp enough to cut the veggies.
open.
a different book.
gone.
gone forever.
empty.
so clean and shiny.
gone forever.
dry.
so shiny and clean.
the best color.
bumpy and bumpy.
burning.
going to freeze.
full.
working hard.
tired.
peaceful.
still in the right spot.
shiny and smooth.
working.
open.
wet.
melting.
open.
loose.
dancing in the wind.
too heavy for the school helpers to move.
flat.
going zoom down the hill.
very cold.
too tight.
all over the ground.
broken.
drying.
