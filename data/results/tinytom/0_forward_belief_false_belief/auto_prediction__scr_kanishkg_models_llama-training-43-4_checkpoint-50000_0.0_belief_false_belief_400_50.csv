too weak to walk.
too heavy for her to carry.
too strong for the squirrels.
ruined.
very special.
too slow and too slow.
broken.
too tight.
too big and too deep.
so smooth and pretty.
ruined.
the best tree in the park.
gone forever.
trying to tell her something.
very lazy.
so beautiful.
so funny.
safe and warm.
for her friend.
so strong and beautiful.
too high and she can't reach it.
going to end.
in trouble.
broken, but it is still very special.
too scared to swim.
very special and she will never forget it.
very pretty, but the worker is very angry.
full of water and she was about to leave it.
trying to take her plate away.
very special and she wants to keep it safe.
so funny and she laughed.
perfect and she is going to jump through it again.
too loud.
going to die.
too weak to be strong.
when she looks around and sees the doggie.
full of hot dogs.
gone forever.
too tight and she can't get the dog to come back.
going to be very tasty.
for him.
so beautiful, she decided to sell them to the people in the city.
having fun, but she is worried.
safe and he smiled.
too wet to play with.
too thick and too sticky.
broken.
so funny.
for her friend.
very naughty.
