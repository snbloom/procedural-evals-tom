not ready to ride.
so cute.
broken, so she decided to help.
ruined.
not safe for him.
too fast for him.
broken.
too small for her camera.
too heavy for him.
too big and she can't carry it.
ruined.
so much fun to watch.
too special to be taken away.
too small to learn a new trick.
very brave and strong.
too big and too strong for her to climb.
not as good as the one she found.
spoiled.
for her friend.
too strong for her.
broken.
not so easy now.
scared, so she decides to stay in the closet until the party was over.
ruined.
too big for her.
not real, but a toy sword that she likes to play with.
very bad and she is very sad.
a big mess.
still waiting for her plate.
too messy to keep and she is sad.
too special to be messed up.
broken.
broken.
sad, so she quickly grabbed them and brought them to the garden.
going to get wet, so she quickly put them back in the bucket.
"the perfect spot!

Amy quickly ran over to the tree and shouted, ""I found you."
so special.
broken and he feels sad.
too long and she can't play with it.
too hard to eat.
broken, so he quickly ate it up.
too expensive, so she decided to sell them.
sad.
so cute and playful.
still playing with her.
too thick and sticky.
safe and she loves it.
not fun anymore.
for her friend.
the best way to stay on track.
