locked.
not as strong as his kite.
not as heavy as before.
inside the present.
empty.
in the box.
empty.
not working.
empty.
filled with air.
not working properly.
not as long as he has a chance to fly.
not finished.
ruined.
on the big, bright sign.
dull.
not so big anymore.
on the top shelf.
hiding.
not working.
not watering the airport job.
dirty.
hiding in a corner.
dry.
clean and ready to be polished.
not on his table.
dirty.
not ready.
melting.
clean.
the same clock that he was working on.
dull.
quiet and still.
all neat and tidy.
not real.
on.
open.
wet.
melting.
closed.
loose.
dancing.
lighter.
bouncing too high.
still rolling down the hill.
in the cold room.
twisted.
empty.
not as strong as before.
dry.
