the best thing ever.
so soft and fluffy, she just wants to touch it.
a surprise.
gone.
"now ready to play!
Yara grabbed the baseball and ran to the park."
a clue.
too much for the horses.
ready to work.
very important.
so pretty now.
ruined.
ruined.
the winner.
too close to the pot, so he drives his truck right into it.
safe.
too bright and he should have put the batteries back.
empty now.
empty.
too loud and she wants to use it right away.
too hard to cut.
