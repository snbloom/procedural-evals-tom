very special.
lost forever.
gone.
so cute and she wants to be friends with it.
not his, but he likes it.
broken, but she still smiles.
too heavy.
dirty, but he does not care.
too loud and he is getting tired.
so yummy and he wants to eat it again.
not safe for little boys to play there.
not safe for him to play in.
so beautiful and she loves it.
so much fun to play with.
too small and not very nice.
ruined.
not safe.
the best place to find frogs.
very cool.
so funny that he laughs and laughs.
too small for her to use.
ruined.
still shiny, but now it is dark and cold.
too sharp for him.
going away.
very nice.
so silly and she giggles.
not safe and he does not want to go there.
broken.
his, but the doggy is too fast.
too sharp for her to chop down, so she quickly puts it back in her bag and leaves the.
too high for her to reach.
not safe.
a trap for the skunk.
broken and he is sad.
melting.
so beautiful and he loves them.
melting.
gone forever.
gone forever.
not a toy.
not for the monkeys.
too heavy.
too smelly and she should take it home.
lost forever.
full of matches.
gone.
lost, so he quickly put it back in his bag.
not clean anymore.
the best thing ever.
