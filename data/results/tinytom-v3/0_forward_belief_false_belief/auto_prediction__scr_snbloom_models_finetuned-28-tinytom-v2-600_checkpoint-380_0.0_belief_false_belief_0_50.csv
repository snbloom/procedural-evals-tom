clean and shiny.
clean.
hidden in his hat.
clean.
still good.
locked.
decreasing.
fresh and fresh.
quiet.
off.
strong and secure.
sharp.
awake.
open.
sharp.
high up.
in its trap.
the birdhouse.
cold.
hard and cold.
in his hand.
on.
smooth and flat.
in her dog's mouth is in her dog's mouth.
clean.
a locket.
long and full of yummy food.
in her book.
smooth and clean.
clean and bright.
close to the water bag.
straight.
not broken.
fresh.
smells good.
tied.
pale.
in the hall.
not moving.
untouched.
clean.
in full bloom.
dry and clean.
fresh.
sharp.
disconnected.
like fresh air.
still in her lunch box.
not flat.
