full.
clean and sparkly.
wasted.
sleeping on a branch.
missing.
on the swing.
wet.
clean.
ready to play.
gone.
locked.
bouncing.
fresh and fresh.
dry.
full of books.
wrapped up and safe.
locked.
quiet.
on.
sitting on the floor.
not usable.
full of lemonade.
shiny.
sharp.
deflated.
smelly.
silly.
open.
standing straight.
sitting on the ground.
dull and old.
up high.
empty.
full of nails.
standing tall and ready to zoom around.
cold.
not smell anymore.
hard.
in his hand.
missing.
missing.
empty.
flying in the wind.
smelling nice.
on her water bottle.
full of matches.
on the ground.
in his bag.
clean.
empty.
