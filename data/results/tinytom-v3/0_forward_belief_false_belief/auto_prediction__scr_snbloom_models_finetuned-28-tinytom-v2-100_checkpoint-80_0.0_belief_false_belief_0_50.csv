full.
clean and shiny.
dirty.
asleep.
on the doggy's tail.
on.
wet.
clean.
ready.
full.
locked.
not as bouncy as before.
dry and fresh.
dry.
full.
wrapped up.
locked.
full of fun and splashes.
off.
full of juice.
not balanced.
on.
still shiny.
sharp.
full of air.
flowers.
awake.
closed.
upside down.
on the ground.
sharp.
tidy.
in the trap.
the nails.
on.
melting.
sweet and clean.
soft and yummy.
lost.
lost.
not in her hut.
empty.
on her.
clean.
on.
empty.
on the ground.
on.
clean.
a special photo.
