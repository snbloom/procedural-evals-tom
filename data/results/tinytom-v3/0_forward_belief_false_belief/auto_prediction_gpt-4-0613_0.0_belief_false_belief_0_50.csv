still full.
lost.
still all there, untouched.
still awake.
still safely hidden in his hat.
magical.
sacred and should not be touched when it's wet.
still dry and safe for him to skate on.
still on and ready to play.
still untouched and ready to eat.
still locked.
still as big and bouncy as before.
still fresh and green, perfect for her art project.
still wet and perfect for building.
magical because every time she looks away, some books disappear and new ones appear in their place.
still perfectly wrapped.
still unlocked.
haunted and gets a little scared.
still off.
still full and ready for everyone to enjoy.
broken due to wear and tear.
still full.
losing its shine.
still sharp and ready to use.
still as big as it was when she first got it.
stone and metal, just like it always has.
still awake and ready to hear her joke.
still open.
moving on its own.
still there, waiting for his kick.
still by her side.
magical.
hiding somewhere else in the house.
skunk spray.
still standing tall and ready.
still as cold and perfect as when he bought it.
still as beautiful as before, even without their sweet scent.
still hard and chilly.
lost in the river.
still intact and ready to fly.
still in the hut.
still full.
still.
ruined.
still tightly closed.
still in its original place.
still on the ground.
still safely tucked away in his bag.
still clean and safe to run on.
only her special four-leaf clover.
