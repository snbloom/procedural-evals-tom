full.
dirty.
dirty and smelly.
sleeping on the bench.
in his hat.
on the swing.
heavy.
dirty.
on.
now wet.
locked.
deflated.
dry and fresh.
dry.
full of books.
wrapped up and securely.
unlocked.
still quiet and still.
off.
full of juice.
weak.
spilled.
dull.
sharp.
smaller.
in the park.
silly.
closed.
standing upright.
lying on the ground.
against the squirrel's axe.
up on the shelf.
empty.
smelly.
standing tall.
cold.
not sweet anymore.
melted.
in his hand.
missing.
missing.
empty.
dancing on her head.
smelly.
on.
full of matches.
on the ground.
in his bag.
cracked.
empty.
