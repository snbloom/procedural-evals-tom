full.
dirty.
dirty.
in his cap.
dusty.
salty.
locked.
brittle.
dry and fresh.
still quiet and still.
off.
bent.
now dull.
sharp.
a pleasant perfume.
asleep.
closed.
wobbling.
rough.
not on the top shelf.
stuck in the trap.
old metal.
bent.
melting.
melted.
in his hand.
lost.
blank.
lost.
cracked.
a locket.
wet.
in her brother's hand.
scratched.
lost in the dog's mouth.
at the water surface.
straight.
cracked.
spoiled.
smells smelly.
untied.
pale.
hanging on the stair railing.
not moving.
unfolded.
hidden under the leaves.
melted.
eaten.
wet.
smelly.
