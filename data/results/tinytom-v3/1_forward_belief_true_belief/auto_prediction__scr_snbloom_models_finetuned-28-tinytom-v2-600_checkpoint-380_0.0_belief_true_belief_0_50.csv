full.
dirty.
dirty.
asleep.
in his cap.
off.
heavy.
dusty.
on.
salty.
locked.
becoming smaller.
dry and fresh.
dry.
full of books.
unwrapped.
unlocked.
still quiet and still.
off.
full.
bent.
spilled.
now dull.
sharp.
losing air.
a pleasant perfume.
asleep.
closed.
wobbling.
lost.
rough.
not on the top shelf.
stuck in the trap.
old metal.
bent.
melting.
sweet.
melted.
in his hand.
lost.
blank.
half full.
still visible.
dirty.
twisted.
empty.
lost.
in his bag.
cracked.
a copy of her locket.
