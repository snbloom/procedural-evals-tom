full of squiggly pasta.
dirty.
dirty.
asleep.
in his hat.
on.
heavy.
clean.
not working.
salty.
locked.
decreasing.
dry.
dry.
full of books.
ripped up.
unlocked.
full of frogs.
off.
spilled.
brittle.
spilled.
dull.
sharp.
losing air.
flowers.
asleep.
closed.
bent.
lost.
rough.
not on the top shelf.
stuck in the trap.
skunk.
bent.
melting.
sweet and smell the sweet juice.
hard and cold.
stolen.
lost.
blank.
half full.
blown away.
dirty.
on tight.
empty.
lost.
lost.
dirty.
a wobbly photo.
