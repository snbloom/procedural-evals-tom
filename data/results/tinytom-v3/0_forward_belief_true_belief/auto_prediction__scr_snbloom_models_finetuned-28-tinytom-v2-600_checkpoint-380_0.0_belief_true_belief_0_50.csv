full of squiggly pasta.
in the mud.
dirty.
sleeping on the branch of the big tree.
in his hat.
on the swing.
heavy.
dirty.
switched on.
now wet and salty.
locked.
now getting smaller.
dry and fresh.
dry.
full of books.
wrapped up and ready to be wrapped.
locked.
uneven.
off.
spilled.
sitting on her spade.
spilled.
dull.
cutting down the tree.
losing air.
smelly.
silly.
closed.
standing straight.
missing from the ground.
against the squirrel's axe.
up high.
empty.
full of nails.
bent.
melting.
smelly.
hard.
in the river.
missing.
lying on the ground.
half full.
dancing on the wind.
smelly.
on the tight stream.
full of matches.
missing.
in his bag.
dirty.
in her locket.
