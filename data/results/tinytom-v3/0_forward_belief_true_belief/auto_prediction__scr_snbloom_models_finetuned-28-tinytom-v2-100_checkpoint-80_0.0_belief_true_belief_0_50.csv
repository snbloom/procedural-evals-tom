full.
clean and shiny.
dirty.
asleep.
lost.
on.
heavy.
clean.
working perfectly.
salty.
locked.
melting.
dry and fresh.
dry.
full.
wrapped up.
locked.
full of frogs.
off.
full.
not strong enough to hold the handle of her shovel.
on.
not shiny.
sharp.
losing air.
flowers.
awake.
closed.
upside down.
on the ground.
sharp.
tidy.
in trouble.
the nails.
bent.
melting.
not smelly anymore.
soft and yummy.
lost.
lost.
not a plaything.
empty.
on her.
clean.
on.
full of matches.
on the ground.
lost.
clean.
a special photo of Mia's favorite toy.
