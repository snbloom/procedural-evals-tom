still full enough for his lunch, so he just smiles at his sister's mischief and continues chopping his.
ruined.
ruined because it fell into the dirty puddle.
dreaming of soaring high in the sky, exploring the vast world beyond the park.
still inside the cap.
magical, as it started working all by itself.
soaked.
now the perfect place to skate.
broken.
now even tastier.
now open for a new adventure.
losing its magic, and he becomes very sad.
no longer suitable for her art project because it has lost its vibrant green color and freshness.
now too dry to build a sand castle.
getting empty.
ruined.
now locked.
alive with activity.
magical because it made the room bright and clear.
empty.
still strong and sturdy, unaware of the pup's mischief.
empty.
losing its shine because of the sun setting.
ruined, but he doesn't get angry at the beaver.
shrinking because of some magic.
fresh flowers.
missing out on the fun.
permanently closed.
going to fall.
his responsibility, so he starts chasing after the dog.
still sharp, unaware of the squirrel's actions.
now even more organized and she might be able to find the special book she is looking for.
stuck and rushes over to help.
skunk now.
broken.
still worth every penny, even if it's melting.
sad because they lost their sweet smell.
ruined.
gone forever.
magical and has the power to make his kite fly higher than any other.
ruined.
now lighter.
alive, as if it has a spirit of its own.
ruined.
gone forever.
ruined.
gone forever.
still inside his bag, unaware that it has fallen out.
now messy and slippery.
her lucky four-leaf clover and a tiny photo of her and Mia.
