empty.
still in the mud puddle.
still there.
dead.
still in his hat.
not working properly.
a part of the horse.
clean.
still on.
still safe.
locked because he is a boy.
still full of air.
still green and fresh.
his friend.
empty.
still safe.
locked.
a safe place.
off because he is afraid of the dark.
still full of juice.
a toy.
still full of lemonade.
still shiny.
still sharp.
getting bigger.
a man.
still awake and watching her.
closed because the owner is not a good person.
a good thing.
still in the doggy's mouth.
still in her hand.
empty.
in the real world.
new metal.
still standing.
still warm.
dead.
still warm.
still in his hand.
still attached to the doggie.
a plaything.
empty.
a symbol of her innocence.
ruined.
still on.
empty.
still in the park.
gone forever.
slippery.
a secret.
