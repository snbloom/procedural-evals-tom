full.
clean.
dirty.
wide awake.
hidden in his hat.
on its way to its owner.
heavy.
clean.
ready.
safe.
locked.
now full of air.
dry.
dry.
full.
wrapped up.
locked.
quiet.
off.
full.
safe.
spilled.
shiny.
sharp.
full.
flowers.
awake.
open.
standing straight.
on the ground.
sharp.
tidy.
in the toy trap.
nails.
on the ground.
cold.
smooth.
soft and yummy.
in his hand.
in the right place.
not blank.
full.
not on her.
clean.
on tight.
full of matches.
on the ground.
in his bag.
clean.
a photo.
