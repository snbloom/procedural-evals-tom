a good idea.
a ball of some sort.
a waste of time.
asleep.
a gift from God.
a toy, but she does not believe it is a real dog.
his.
empty.
working fine.
a joke.
locked.
going to collapse.
a good thing.
a good idea, but he does not know what to do with it.
empty.
a gift for her friend.
locked.
a place of magic.
a sign of a bad dream.
a prank.
a good thing.
a sign of her innocence.
a toy.
a trap.
just a little bit bigger than the one she was sitting on.
roses.
asleep.
closed because of the man who owned it.
a mirror.
still in his mouth, but he does not believe it is in his mouth.
a gift from the squirrel.
a good place to store her toys.
in the toy trap.
new metal.
a toy.
a good idea.
just a little too sweet.
melted.
a dog.
a good thing.
a toy.
a gift from the zoo.
a reflection of her body.
a trap.
a sign of her love for the dog.
a good idea.
a toy of a squirrel, but the squirrel is not.
a toy, but he does not know what it is.
a good one.
a secret.
