the best thing ever.
ruined.
yucky now.
so cute and she smiles.
gone forever.
so cool! She can't wait to show her friends the video.
too wet.
a big playground.
fair, because it was the right size for him.
gone forever.
a secret.
going to disappear.
lovely.
fun and the dogs are fun.
very empty.
ruined.
locked.
the best place in the world.
a magic switch.
funny, but his joke is not.
too old and broken to use.
gone forever.
very pretty.
too loud.
gone forever.
a smelly flower.
so silly that she giggles and covers her ears with her hands.
empty and sad.
still there, but now it is on the floor, and she cannot see her dog.
gone forever.
the best tool ever.
the best place to find books.
playing a game.
"the skunk!
Ben's mom saw what happened and ran out to the garden."
broken.
gone forever.
happy now.
the best cheese ever.
gone forever.
gone forever.
gone forever.
very special.
a magic veil.
ruined.
gone forever.
full of potential.
gone forever.
gone forever.
over.
a secret.
