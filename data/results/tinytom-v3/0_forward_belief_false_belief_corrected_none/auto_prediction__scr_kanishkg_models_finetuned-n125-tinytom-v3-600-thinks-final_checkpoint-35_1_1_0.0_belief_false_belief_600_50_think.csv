now full of sand.
ee is still in the toy box.
safe.
open.
not in her bag.
gone forever.
broken too.
empty.
still full of toys.
not round anymore.
still.
gear is still on the beach, but he is not happy.
untied.
untangled.
now full of sand.
not full of eggs.
finished.
quiet.
awake now.
still dusty.
safe and sound.
still tidy and ready to be used.
stretched.
now a mess.
now full of bright colors.
not ready to be used.
in the ground.
still smooth and shiny.
clean and shiny.
empty.
gone.
still working.
kite is now red.
full.
still in perfect shape.
gone.
now hers.
is not full of flowers anymore.
empty.
still there.
still standing tall and proud.
still tidy.
still a bit tricky.
now in pieces.
still cold and yummy.
camera is ruined.
strong enough to hold the swing.
st fish is swimming away.
journal is safe and sound.
still in his hand.
