full.
clean and sparkly.
fresh.
awake.
in his hat.
on.
heavy.
empty.
working.
still fresh.
locked.
full of air.
fresh.
wet and wet.
full.
wrapped up tight.
locked.
quiet.
off.
full.
strong.
full.
shiny.
sharp.
full of air.
flowers.
awake.
open.
standing straight.
on the ground.
sharp.
tidy.
in the toy trap.
new metal.
standing tall and ready.
cold.
smooth.
cold and hard.
in his hand.
attached.
flat.
full.
still on her head.
clean.
securely fastened.
empty.
on the ground.
in his bag.
clean.
a photo of her lucky clover.
