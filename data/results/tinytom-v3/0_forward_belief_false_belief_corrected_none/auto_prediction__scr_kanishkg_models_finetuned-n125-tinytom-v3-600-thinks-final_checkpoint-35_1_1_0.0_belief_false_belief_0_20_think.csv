full.
still clean and sparkly.
still there.
asleep.
gone forever.
working perfectly now! She is so happy that she can now take her picture.
wet.
clean.
working fine.
now salty and yucky.
unlocked.
ruined.
still in perfect condition.
wet and sticky.
not full of books.
ruined.
unlocked.
quiet and still.
off.
still full of juice.
still firmly in her hand.
still there.
still shiny.
sharp.
still big and red.
something sour.
asleep so quickly that she starts to giggle.
open.
broken.
in his mouth.
still sharp.
now neat and tidy.
stuck.
fresh paint.
broken.
now a puddle.
still there, but they are not.
melted.
gone forever.
now tangled.
ruined.
still clean.
still there.
still working.
now empty.
burning.
safe in the tree.
lost.
clean again.
the special four-leaf clover.
now full of toys.
still clear.
gone, and she starts to cry.
still there.
still there.
full of ink and starts to draw on the wall.
now full of big, scary creatures.
dry and ready to play.
gone.
gone.
now empty.
still there.
happy with the show.
not strong enough to hold her picture.
broken.
ruined.
