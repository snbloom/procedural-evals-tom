full.
clean.
dirty.
sleeping.
on the dog's collar.
on the swing.
wet.
clean.
ready.
wet.
locked.
not as big and bouncy as before.
dry.
dry.
full.
wrapped up.
locked.
dry.
off.
full of juice.
not wiggling.
full.
still shiny.
sharp.
melting.
flowers.
awake.
open.
standing straight.
on the ground.
sharp.
not tidy.
in the trap.
the nails.
not on the ground.
melting.
not smelly anymore.
soft and yummy.
in the water.
on the ground.
not a plaything.
empty.
on her.
clean.
on tight.
full of matches.
on the ground.
on the ground.
clean.
a new photo.
