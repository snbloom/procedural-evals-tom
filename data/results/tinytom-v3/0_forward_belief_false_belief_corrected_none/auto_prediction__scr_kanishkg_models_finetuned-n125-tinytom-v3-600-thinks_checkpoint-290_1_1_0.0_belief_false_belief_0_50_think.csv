full.
clean and sparkly.
dirty.
sleeping.
in the dog's mouth.
working.
heavy.
clean.
working.
not covered in salt.
unlocked.
full of air.
dry.
wet.
full.
not wrapped up tight.
locked.
full of frogs.
off.
full.
strong.
spilled.
shiny.
sharp.
full of air.
flowers.
awake and ready to hear his joke.
open.
straight.
in the dog's mouth.
sharp.
on the top shelf.
in the toy trap.
new metal.
still standing tall and ready to zoom.
melted.
sweet again.
soft and warm.
in the dog's mouth.
back in its place.
not a plaything.
full.
still on her head.
clean.
on.
empty.
on the ground.
in his bag.
clean.
a special message.
