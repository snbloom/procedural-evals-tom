now full of ink.
ee is still in his hand.
lucky.
shut tight.
in his mouth.
gone forever.
broken too.
not empty.
still full of toys.
now spoiled.
still.
gear is still on the beach, but he is very angry.
now tied in a knot.
tangled and knotted.
now full.
now full of baby birds.
finished.
quiet.
awake now.
still dusty.
safe now.
now full of paint.
stretched out.
now a mess.
now full of bright colors.
not ready to be used.
in the ground.
still smooth and shiny.
now full of ink.
empty.
gone forever.
still working.
kite is now red.
full.
still in perfect shape.
gone.
now small and easy to play.
is not full of flowers anymore.
now full.
now short and not long anymore.
still standing tall and proud.
still tidy.
now complete.
now a big, messy piece.
still cold and sweet.
camera is ruined.
now weak.
st fish is caught by the ducks.
journal is safe in his mommy's hand.
now his.
