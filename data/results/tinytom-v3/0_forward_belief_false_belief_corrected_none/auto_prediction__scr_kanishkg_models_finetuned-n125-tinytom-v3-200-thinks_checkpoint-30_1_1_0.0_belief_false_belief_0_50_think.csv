full of squiggly pasta.
clean and sparkly.
clean.
asleep.
in his hat.
on.
heavy.
clean.
working.
salty.
unlocked.
full of air.
fresh and green.
wet.
full of books.
wrapped up tight.
locked.
quiet.
off.
full.
strong.
full.
shiny.
sharp.
full of air.
flowers.
awake.
open.
standing up straight.
in its mouth.
sharp.
tidy.
in the toy trap.
new metal.
standing tall and ready to be used.
cold.
smooth.
fresh and yummy.
in his hand.
tied up.
not flat.
full.
on her head.
clean.
on.
empty.
on the ground.
in his bag.
clean.
a photo of her lucky clover.
