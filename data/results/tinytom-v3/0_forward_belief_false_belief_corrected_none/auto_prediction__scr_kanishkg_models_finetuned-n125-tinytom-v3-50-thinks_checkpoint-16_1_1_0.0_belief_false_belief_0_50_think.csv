snoozing.
on his head.
on.
wet.
clean.
working.
not yummy.
unlocked.
full of air.
dry.
wet.

wrapped up tight.
locked.
full of frogs.
off.
full.
not broken.

shiny.
sharp.
full of air.
flowers.
wide awake.
open.
standing up straight.
on the ground.
sharp.
tidy.
playing with her teddy bear.
new nails.
on the ground.
full.
fresh.
soft and yummy.
in its mouth.
on the ground.
not a plaything.
empty.
dancing.
clean.
on.
empty.
on the ground.
on the ground.
clean.
a special message.
