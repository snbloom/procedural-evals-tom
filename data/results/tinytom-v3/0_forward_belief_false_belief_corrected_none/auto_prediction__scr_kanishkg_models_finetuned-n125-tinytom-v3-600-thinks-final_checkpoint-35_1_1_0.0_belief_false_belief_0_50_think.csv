full.
still clean and sparkly.
still there.
asleep.
gone forever.
working perfectly now! She is so happy that she can now take her picture.
wet.
clean.
working fine.
now salty and yucky.
unlocked.
ruined.
still in perfect condition.
wet and sticky.
not full of books.
ruined.
unlocked.
quiet and still.
off.
still full of juice.
still firmly in her hand.
still there.
still shiny.
sharp.
still big and red.
something sour.
asleep so quickly that she starts to giggle.
open.
broken.
in his mouth.
still sharp.
now neat and tidy.
stuck.
fresh paint.
broken.
now a puddle.
still there, but they are not.
melted.
gone forever.
now tangled.
ruined.
still clean.
still there.
still working.
now empty.
burning.
safe in the tree.
lost.
clean again.
the special four-leaf clover.
