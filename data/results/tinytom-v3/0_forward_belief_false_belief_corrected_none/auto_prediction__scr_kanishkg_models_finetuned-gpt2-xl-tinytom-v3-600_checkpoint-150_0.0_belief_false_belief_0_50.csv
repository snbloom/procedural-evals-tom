full.
clean.
fresh.
awake.
in his hat.
working.
dry.
empty.
on.
salty.
locked.
big and full of air.
fresh and green.
wet.
full.
wrapped up tight.
unlocked.
still.
off.
full.
strong.
full.
shiny.
sharp.
full of air.
flowers.
awake and ready to listen.
open.
straight.
on the ground.
sharp.
tidy.
in the toy box.
new metal.
standing tall.
cold.
sweet.
hard and cold.
in his hand.
on a reel.
flat.
full.
still.
clean.
tight.
empty.
on the ground.
in his bag.
clean.
a photo of her and her friend.
