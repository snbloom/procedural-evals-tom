full.
clean.
in the bag.
wide awake.
in his hat.
on its way to the park.
heavy.
clean.
ready.
full.
locked.
not as big and bouncy as before.
green and fresh.
dry.
full.
wrapped up.
locked.
quiet.
off.
full of juice.
strong.
full.
shiny.
sharp.
full of air.
flowers.
awake.
open.
standing straight.
on the ground.
sharp.
tidy.
in the toy trap.
new wood.
on.
cold.
smooth.
hard and cold.
in his hand.
on the ground.
not blank.
full.
blown away.
clean.
on tight.
full of matches.
on the ground.
in his bag.
clean.
a photo.
