empty.
dirty and yucky.
ruined.
so cute and peaceful.
gone.
working perfectly now! She is so happy that she can now take her picture.
wet.
clean.
working perfectly.
now salty and yummy.
not locked anymore.
ruined.
now in full bloom.
wet and soft.
not full of books.
ruined.
unlocked.
quiet and still.
off.
broken.
not ready to be used.
now empty.
not shiny anymore.
working perfectly.
deflated.
fresh air.
so cute and she giggles.
open and ready to welcome him.
broken.
"gone!
Carl thinks the dog has taken the ball."
now sharp.
now neat and tidy.
stuck.
fresh wood.
broken.
not full of pennies anymore.
still there, but they are not as big as before.
melted.
gone forever.
now tangled.
ruined.
not full.
now in a big, beautiful veil.
wet.
now empty.
burning.
in danger of being taken away by the squirrel.
not in his bag anymore.
now clean.
the special four-leaf clover's special photo.
