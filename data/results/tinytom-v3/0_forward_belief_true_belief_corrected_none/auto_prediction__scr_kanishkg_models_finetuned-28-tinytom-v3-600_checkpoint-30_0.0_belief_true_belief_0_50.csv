not full.
not clean.
dirty.
asleep.
in his hand.
on the ground.
heavy.
clean.
not working.
not on his plate.
unlocked.
melting.
dry and fresh.
wet.
full.
torn.
unlocked.
not filled with water.
off.
spilled.
not working properly.
spilled.
not shiny.
sharp.
losing air.
flowers.
asleep.
closed.
wobbling.
on the ground.
scratched.
not on the top shelf.
in the trap.
nails.
bent.
melting.
fresh.
melted.
in his hand.
scattered on the ground.
not smooth.
empty.
blown by the wind.
dirty.
on tight.
not full of yummy food.
on the ground.
out of his bag.
not clean.
