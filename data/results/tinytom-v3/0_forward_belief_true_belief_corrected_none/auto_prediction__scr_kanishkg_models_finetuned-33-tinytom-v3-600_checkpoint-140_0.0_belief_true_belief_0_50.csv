full.
dirty.
dirty.
asleep.
not hidden.
working.
heavy.
messy.
working.
not there.
locked.
full of air.
dry.
dry.
full.
not wrapped.
locked.
quiet.
on.
empty.
wobbly.
spilled.
shiny.
sharp.
full of air.
flowers.
asleep.
open.
wobbling.
not in his goal.
sharp.
neatly organized.
in the toy trap.
new nails.
bent.
turning into a puddle.
smelling sweet.
melted.
in its hand.
not attached.
not in her hut.
empty.
still on her head.
dirty.
tight.
not full.
in its home.
in his bag.
not clean.
a special photo.
