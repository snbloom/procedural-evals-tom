empty.
dirty and dirty and she wants it back.
hers.
a baby bird and she wants to take it home.
gone.
broken.
heavy because it is wet.
clean.
off.
ruined.
locked because he is a boy.
going to fall down on him.
dead.
going to be a great castle.
empty.
gone.
locked.
alive and wants to go in.
off because he is afraid of the dark.
ruined and decides to fix it.
broken.
broken.
going to be gone.
broken.
getting smaller because she is getting smaller.
flowers.
asleep because she can't see him.
closed because the owner is not there.
broken.
his, and he wants it back.
gone forever.
empty.
in the toy trap.
skunk.
broken.
melting.
dead.
gone forever.
his.
gone forever.
a plaything and wants to make a picture of it.
empty.
a sign that she is going to die.
ruined.
broken.
full of poison.
hers, and she grabs it.
broken and he is going to have to go to the park to get it.
ruined.
a secret.
