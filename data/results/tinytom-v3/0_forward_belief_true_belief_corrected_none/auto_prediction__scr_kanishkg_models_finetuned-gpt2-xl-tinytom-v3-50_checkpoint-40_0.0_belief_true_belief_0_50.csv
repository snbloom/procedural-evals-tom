full.
dirty.
dirty.
asleep.
missing.
not working.
heavy.
clean.
off.
salty.
locked.
getting smaller.
dry.
dry.
empty.
not safe.
locked.
wiggling.
off.
broken.
wobbly.
broken.
not as shiny as it was earlier in the day.
dull.
getting smaller.
flowers.
asleep.
closed.
tilted.
not on the field.
dull.
tidy.
in the toy trap.
new metal.
broken.
cold.
no longer sweet.
hard and cold.
gone.
untied.
broken.
empty.
fluttering.
dirty.
loose.
dirty.
on the ground.
missing.
dirty.
a photo of her and Mia.
