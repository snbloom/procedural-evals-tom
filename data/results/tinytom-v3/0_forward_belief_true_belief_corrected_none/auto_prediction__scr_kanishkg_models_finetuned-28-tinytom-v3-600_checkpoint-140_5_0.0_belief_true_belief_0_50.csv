full.
not clean.
dirty.
wide awake.
in his hat.
on the ground.
heavy.
clean.
on.
wet.
locked.
melting.
green and fresh.
wet.
full.
torn.
locked.
rough.
off.
full of juice.
weak.
spilled.
shiny.
sharp.
losing air.
flowers.
asleep.
closed.
wobbling.
on the ground.
sharp.
not in its place.
in the trap.
nails.
bent.
melting.
smelly.
melted.
in his hand.
on the ground.
rough.
empty.
on her.
wet.
on tight.
empty.
on the ground.
on his bag.
dirty.
a photo of Mia.
