full of squiggly pasta.
dirty.
dirty.
sleeping.
in its mouth.
off.
heavy.
clean.
off.
salty.
unlocked.
deflated.
dry.
wet.
empty.
torn.
locked.
wavy.
off.
empty.
not strong.
spilled.
shiny.
sharp.
deflated.
flowers.
awake.
closed.
wobbling.
on the ground.
sharp.
tidy.
in the toy trap.
new metal.
bent and not straight.
melted.
not fresh.
melted.
in its mouth.
loose.
not in its place.
empty.
moving.
dirty.
off.
empty.
on the ground.
loose.
turned off.
a photo of her lucky clover.
