full.
clean and sparkly.
fresh.
awake.
in his hat.
on.
heavy.
empty.
working.
still fresh.
locked.
full of air.
fresh and green.
wet and wet.
full.
wrapped up tight.
locked.
quiet and still.
off.
full.
strong.
full.
shiny.
sharp.
full of air.
fresh flowers.
awake and ready to listen.
open.
standing straight.
on the ground.
sharp.
tidy.
in the toy trap.
new metal.
standing tall and ready.
cold.
smooth.
cold and hard.
in his hand.
attached.
flat.
full.
still on her head.
clean.
securely fastened.
empty.
on the ground.
in his bag.
clean.
a lucky clover.
