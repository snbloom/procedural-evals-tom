not full of yummy food.
dirty.
wet.
asleep.
not shiny anymore.
not on.
heavy.
shiny.
switched off.
not as yummy as the seagull's feathers.
unlocked.
getting smaller.
green and fresh.
dry.
full.
ripped.
locked.
quiet.
off.
empty.
bent.
wet.
shiny.
sharp.
full of air.
flowers.
asleep.
closed.
wobbling.
not on the ground.
rough.
tidy.
in the toy trap.
metal.
not standing up.
melting.
not as sweet as before.
hard.
on the bridge.
bent.
bent.
full.
dancing.
dirty.
loose.
not full of matches.
in its cozy home.
loose.
clean.
