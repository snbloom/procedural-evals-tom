full.
not clean.
dirty.
sleeping.
not on his hat.
on its way to its owner.
heavy.
clean.
ready.
not on the beach.
locked.
not as big as before.
dry.
dry.
full.
torn.
locked.
full of surprises.
off.
full.
not wobbly.
on the table.
still shiny.
sharp.
getting smaller.
flowers.
awake and ready to play.
open.
wobbling.
on the ground.
sharp.
not tidy.
in the trap.
the nails.
not as shiny as before.
melting.
not smelly anymore.
soft and yummy.
in the water.
missing.
not in her hut.
empty.
on her.
clean.
on tight.
full of matches.
on its way to the squirrel's home.
on the ground.
clean.
a new photo.
