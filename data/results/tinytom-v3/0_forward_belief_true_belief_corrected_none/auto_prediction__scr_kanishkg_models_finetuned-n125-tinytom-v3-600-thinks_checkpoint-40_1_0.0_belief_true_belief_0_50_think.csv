empty.
dirty.
dirty.
asleep.
not in its mouth.
not on.
heavy.
clean.
not working.
salty.
unlocked.
deflated.
dry.
wet.
empty.
torn.
locked.
wiggly.
off.
spilled.
not strong.
spilled.
not shiny.
not sharp.
deflated.
flowers.
awake.
closed.
wobbling.
not on the ground.
sharp.
tidy.
in the toy trap.
new metal.
bent.
melted.
not fresh.
melted.
not in its mouth.
not attached.
not flat anymore.
empty.
moving.
muddy.
off.
not empty.
on the ground.
not in his bag.
bent.
a photo of her lucky clover.
