full.
not clean.
dirty.
wide awake.
not in his hat.
not on.
heavy.
clean.
working.
not on the sea.
locked.
not as big as before.
dry.
dry.
full.
torn.
locked.
full of frogs.
off.
full.
not wobbly.
spilled.
not shiny.
sharp.
losing air.
flowers.
asleep.
closed.
wobbling.
in his mouth.
rough.
not tidy.
stuck.
nails.
bent.
melting.
not fresh anymore.
hard.
in his hand.
missing.
not in her hut.
empty.
blown away.
dirty.
on tight.
full of matches.
on the ground.
lost.
clean.
