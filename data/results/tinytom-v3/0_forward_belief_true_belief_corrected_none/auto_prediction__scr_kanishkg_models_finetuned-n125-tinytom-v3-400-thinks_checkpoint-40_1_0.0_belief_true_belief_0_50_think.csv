empty.
dirty.
dirty.
asleep.
not in its mouth.
not on.
heavy.
not clean.
off.
salty.
unlocked.
deflated.
dry.
wet.
empty.
torn.
locked.
wiggly.
off.
spilled.
not strong.
spilled.
not shiny.
not sharp.
deflated.
flowers.
asleep.
closed.
wobbling.
not on the ground.
rough.
not tidy.
in the toy trap.
new metal.
not standing tall and ready.
melted.
not fresh.
melted.
in the dog's mouth.
loose.
not folded.
empty.
moving.
dirty.
off.
not empty.
on the ground.
not in his bag.
turned off.
a photo of her lucky clover.
