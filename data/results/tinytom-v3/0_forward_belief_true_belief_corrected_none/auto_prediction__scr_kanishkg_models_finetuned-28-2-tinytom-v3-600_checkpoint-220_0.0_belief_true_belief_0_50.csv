not full.
not clean.
dirty.
asleep.
in his hat.
on the ground.
heavy.
clean.
not working.
wet.
locked.
not big anymore.
dry.
wet.
full.
torn.
locked.
not full of water.
off.
full.
not wobbly.
spilled.
shiny.
sharp.
losing air.
flowers.
asleep.
closed.
wobbling.
in his mouth.
scratched.
not in its place.
stuck.
nails.
bent.
melting.
not smelly anymore.
melted.
in his hand.
scattered on the ground.
not in her hut.
empty.
blown away.
dirty.
on tight.
empty.
on the ground.
on his bag.
dirty.
a photo of Mia's friend.
