full.
not clean.
dirty.
sleeping.
not on his hat.
on its way to its owner.
heavy.
clean.
ready.
not on the beach.
locked.
not as big as before.
dry.
dry.
full.
wrapped up.
locked.
full of surprises.
off.
full.
not wobbly.
on the table.
still shiny.
sharp.
losing air.
flowers.
awake and ready to play.
open.
wobbling.
on the ground.
sharp.
not tidy.
in the trap.
the nails.
not as ready as he is.
melting.
not smelly anymore.
soft and yummy.
in the water.
missing.
not a plaything.
empty.
on her.
clean.
on tight.
full of matches.
on its way to her friend's house.
on the ground.
clean.
a new photo of her friend.
