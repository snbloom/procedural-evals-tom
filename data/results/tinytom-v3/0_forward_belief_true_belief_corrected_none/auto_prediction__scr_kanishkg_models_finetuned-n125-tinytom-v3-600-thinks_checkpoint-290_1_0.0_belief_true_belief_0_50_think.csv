full.
dirty.
dirty.
sleeping.
in the dog's mouth.
off.
heavy.
clean.
working.
not yummy anymore.
unlocked.
spoiled.
dry.
wet.
empty.
torn.
locked.
a fun place to play.
off.
still full.
not strong enough to dig holes.
spilled.
not shiny anymore.
sharp.
full of air.
flowers.
sleeping.
open.
not standing straight.
in the dog's mouth.
sharp.
on the top shelf.
in the toy trap.
new metal.
not broken.
melted.
not fresh anymore.
melted.
in the dog's mouth.
loose.
not a plaything.
empty.
still on her head.
still working.
off.
empty.
on the ground.
in the dog's bag.
bent.
a special message.
