not full.
not clean.
dirty.
asleep.
in his hat.
not on the swing.
heavy.
clean.
not working.
salty.
unlocked.
melting.
dry and fresh.
wet.
full.
torn.
unlocked.
rough.
off.
spilled.
weak.
spilled.
dull.
sharp.
losing air.
flowers.
asleep.
closed.
wobbling.
on the ground.
sharp.
high up on the top shelf.
not in the toy trap.
nails.
bent.
melting.
not smelly anymore.
melted.
scattered on the ground.
rolled out.
rough.
not full.
blown by the wind.
muddy.
on tight.
empty.
on the ground.
out of the bag.
dirty.
a photo.
