not full.
not clean.
dirty.
asleep.
not in his hat.
not on.
heavy.
clean.
working.
not on his plate.
locked.
not as big as before.
dry.
dry.
full.
torn.
unlocked.
rough.
off.
spilled.
not strong.
spilled.
shiny.
sharp.
losing air.
flowers.
asleep.
closed.
wobbling.
not on the ground.
sharp.
not high up.
in the trap.
nails.
bent.
melting.
sweet and smell fresh.
melted.
in his hand.
rolled out.
not in her hut.
not full.
blown by the wind.
muddy.
on tight.
empty.
out in the squirrel's home.
out of the bag.
dirty.
a photo.
