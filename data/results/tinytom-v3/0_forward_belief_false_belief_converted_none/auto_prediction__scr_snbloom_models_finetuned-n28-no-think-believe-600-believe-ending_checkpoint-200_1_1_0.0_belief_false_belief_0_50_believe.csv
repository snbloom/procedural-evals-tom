empty.
clean and shiny.
dirty.
asleep.
safe.
not on the swing.
not heavy.
clean.
working properly.
not as yummy as before.
locked.
full of air.
dry and dry.
dry and the sand is dry.
full of books.
safe.
locked.
a mess.
off.
full of juice.
not working properly.
full of water.
not shiny anymore.
sharp.
not so big and it is not as big as the birds' nest.
the flowers.
still asleep on the couch.
open.
still standing.
not in the goal.
sharp and she is able to chop down the tree.
neat and tidy.
empty.
nice.
not as shiny as before.
not as sweet as before.
not as pretty as before.
not soft and yummy anymore.
still on the bridge.
untied.
a mess.
empty.
not on her head.
nice.
on the ground.
empty.
safe and secure.
not in his bag.
clean.
empty.
