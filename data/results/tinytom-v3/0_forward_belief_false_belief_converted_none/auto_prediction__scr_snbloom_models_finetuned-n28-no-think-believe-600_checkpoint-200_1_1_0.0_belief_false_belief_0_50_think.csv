full of squiggly veggies.
clean and shiny.
dirty.
asleep.
safe.
not broken.
not heavy.
clean.
working properly.
not as yummy as the seagull's sandwich.
open.
full of air.
dry and dry.
dry and the sand is dry.
full of books.
safe.
locked.
a mess.
off.
full of juice.
not as strong as before.
full of water.
not shiny anymore.
sharp.
not so big anymore.
the flowers.
still asleep on the couch.
open.
still standing.
not in the goal.
safe and she is able to chop down the tree.
neat and tidy.
empty.
nice.
not as shiny as before.
not as sweet as before.
not so pretty anymore.
not soft and yummy anymore.
still standing on the bridge.
still on the ground.
a mess.
empty.
not on her head.
nice and the perfume smells nice.
on the ground.
empty.
safe and Daisy is happy.
not important.
not clean.
empty.
