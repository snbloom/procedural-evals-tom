not full.
not clean.
dirty.
asleep.
in his hat.
not on.
heavy.
clean.
working.
not on his picnic spot.
unlocked.
not as big and bouncy as before.
dry and fresh.
wet.
full.
torn and ripped.
unlocked.
muddy.
off.
spilled.
not strong.
spilled.
not shiny.
sharp.
losing air.
the pretty flowers.
asleep.
closed.
wobbling.
not on the ground.
rough.
not up on the top shelf.
balanced.
like nails is not fresh.
bent.
cold.
not fresh.
hard and cold.
in his hand.
rolling away.
not smooth.
empty.
blown by the wind.
bad.
on tight.
not full.
out of sight.
out of the bag.
dirty.
not in her locket.
