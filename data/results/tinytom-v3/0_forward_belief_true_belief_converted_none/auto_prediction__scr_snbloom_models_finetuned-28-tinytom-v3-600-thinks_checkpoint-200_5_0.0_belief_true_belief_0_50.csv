full.
dirty.
dirty.
wide awake.
in his hat.
on the ground.
heavy.
clean.
not working.
wet.
locked.
melting.
green and fresh.
wet.
full.
torn.
locked.
wet.
off.
spilled.
not strong.
spilled.
not shiny anymore.
sharp.
losing air.
in the park.
wide awake.
closed.
wobbling.
on the ground.
rough.
on the top shelf.
empty.
wet.
bent.
cold.
smelly.
hard.
in his hand.
scattered on the ground.
not smooth.
empty.
blown away.
dirty.
on tight.
empty.
on the ground.
in his bag.
dirty.
empty.
