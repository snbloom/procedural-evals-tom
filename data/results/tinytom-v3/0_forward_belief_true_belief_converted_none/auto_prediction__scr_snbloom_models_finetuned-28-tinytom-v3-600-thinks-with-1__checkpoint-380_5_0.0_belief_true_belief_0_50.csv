sleeping on a branch.
in his hat.
on the ground.

getting smaller.
dry and fresh.
wet.
not full.
torn.
unlocked.
muddy.
off.

wobbling.
on the ground.
rough.
up on the top shelf.
balanced.
like nails.
on the ground.
cold.
smelly.
hard and cold.
in the dog's mouth.
scattered on the ground.
not smooth.
not full.
blown.

on tight.
not full.
in the tree.
in his bag.
dirty.
not in her locket.
