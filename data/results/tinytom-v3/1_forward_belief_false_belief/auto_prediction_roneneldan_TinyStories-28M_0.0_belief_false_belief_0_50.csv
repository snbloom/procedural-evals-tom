very special.
lost forever.
spoiled.
sleeping so soundly that she is too lazy to get up.
not in his hat.
broken and she is sad.
too heavy for him.
empty, but he is happy with his clean and shiny skates.
too loud and he is scared.
"so tasty!
."
not safe for a little boy to play there.
not as fun as he thought it was.
so beautiful and special.
so much fun to play with.
too small and not very nice.
not safe for the kitty to be wrapped.
not locked anymore.
the best place to find frogs.
very cool.
full of juice, but his friends still laugh.
too strong for her.
ruined.
still shiny, but now it is dark and cold.
too sharp for him.
gone forever.
the most special thing in the park.
funny and she laughs and laughs.
not safe.
broken.
his goal, and he is so happy! He kicks the ball with all his might and it goes.
the best thing ever.
too tall for her to reach.
not safe.
"a trap! 

The skunk runs away with the bag of nails."
broken and he is sad.
melting.
so sweet and he believes he is the luckiest boy in the world.
melting.
so cute, he just couldn't help but smile.
gone forever.
not a toy and she is sad.
not so important.
not real.
too special for her.
the best thing ever.
full of matches.
gone.
in his bag, so he quickly grabs it and runs away.
not clear anymore.
empty, but she believes that Mia will find it again soon.
