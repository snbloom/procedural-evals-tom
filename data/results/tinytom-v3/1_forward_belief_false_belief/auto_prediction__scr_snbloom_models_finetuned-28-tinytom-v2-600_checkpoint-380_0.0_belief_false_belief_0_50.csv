full.
clean and shiny.
fresh and fresh.
sleeping.
in his hat.
on the swing.
heavy.
clean.
on.
gone.
locked.
deflated.
fresh and fresh.
wet and good for building.
full of books.
wrapped up and securely.
unlocked.
quiet and still.
off.
full of juice.
weak.
full of lemonade.
dull.
sharp.
bigger and full of air.
smelling fresh.
silly.
open.
standing upright.
on the ground.
dull.
up to a high shelf.
empty.
smelly.
standing tall.
cold.
sweet.
hard and cold.
in his hand.
tied on the reel.
missing.
full.
dancing on her head.
smelling nice.
on.
full of matches.
on the ground.
in his bag.
clear and free of ice.
empty.
