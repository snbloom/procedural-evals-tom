full.
clean and shiny.
fresh and smells good.
in his cap.
empty.
tasty.
locked.
inflated.
fresh and fresh.
quiet and still.
off.
strong.
sharp.
a petal to a petal to a petal.
awake.
open.
standing upright.
sharp.
organized.
in the trap.
old metal.
upright.
cold.
solid.
in his hand.
securely fastened on the reel.
straight and smooth.
on the ground.
clear and free of ice.
a locket.
long and full of food.
full of ink.
dirty.
clean and bright.
near the water.
straight.
intact.
fresh.
smells sweet.
tied.
green and big.
hanging on the stair railing.
still on the hill.
new.
clean and clear.
in full bloom.
dry.
fresh.
sharp.
untwisted.
