full.
clean and shiny.
clean.
asleep.
in his hat.
off.
not heavy.
empty.
on.
full.
locked.
not as big and bouncier as before.
dry and fresh.
dry.
full.
wrapped up.
locked.
silent.
off.
full.
strong.
full.
not dull.
sharp.
full of air.
the flowers.
awake.
open.
standing tall.
on the ground.
sharp.
tidy and neat.
inside the trap.
old metal.
bent.
cold.
sweet.
melted.
in his hand.
tied to the reel.
straight and smooth.
empty.
still on her head.
clean.
loose.
full.
on the ground.
in his bag.
clean.
a little slip of the locket.
