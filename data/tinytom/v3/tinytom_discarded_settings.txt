{'noun': 'drain', 'verb': 'win', 'adj': 'nervous', 'word': '', 'features': [], 'property': 'tangled or untangled (e.g., a necklace, a rope)'}{'reasoning': " The story doesn't specify whether the ants marching into the coffee cup would cause it to cool down. It's not a predictable cause of the change in state."}
{'noun': 'perfume', 'verb': 'decorate', 'adj': 'funny', 'word': '', 'features': [], 'property': 'melted or solid (e.g., an ice cream, a candle)'}{'reasoning': ' Wally is watching the birds and not paying attention to his cup of coffee. Although the ants marching into his cup is an unlikely cause for the coffee to cool down, Wally could fail to notice the change in temperature until he takes a sip.'}
{'noun': 'spade', 'verb': 'follow', 'adj': 'humble', 'word': '', 'features': [], 'property': 'rigidity (e.g., is the object hard, soft, or bendable)'}{'reasoning': " It seems implausible that the sun's rays could heat the spade to such an extent that it becomes hot and bendable. The sun can warm up objects but not to the point of altering their physical state, especially a spade which is made of metal."}
{'noun': 'vendor', 'verb': 'listen', 'adj': 'graceful', 'word': '', 'features': [], 'property': 'state of matter (e.g., is the object solid, liquid, or gas)'}{'reasoning': ' The bird flew away when the ice cream vendor passed by making loud noise. Since Jill was watching the bird, she would notice if the bird flew away. The noise from the ice cream vendor is a valid reason for the bird to get scared and fly away.'}
{'noun': 'hippo', 'verb': 'spray', 'adj': 'anxious', 'word': '', 'features': [], 'property': 'wet or dry (e.g., a towel, a sponge)'}{'reasoning': " You didn't provide a story for me to evaluate."}
{'noun': 'match', 'verb': 'teach', 'adj': 'useful', 'word': '', 'features': [], 'property': 'brightness (e.g., is the object bright, dim, or dark)'}{'reasoning': " The sun moving across the sky and causing a tree's shadow to cover the chessboard is a valid reason for the chessboard to become dim. But since Nia is in the park and playing chess, she would likely notice the change in brightness of the chessboard."}
{'noun': 'knee', 'verb': 'burn', 'adj': 'disgusting', 'word': '', 'features': [], 'property': 'state of matter (e.g., is the object solid, liquid, or gas)'}{'reasoning': ' Wendy tripped on a rock and hurt her knee.

{'noun': 'park', 'verb': 'reach', 'adj': 'boring', 'word': '', 'features': [], 'property': 'state of matter (e.g., is the object solid, liquid, or gas)'}{'reasoning': " It's unlikely that the sun could heat the ball to such an extent that it would become soft in the short amount of time that Gary was reaching for a drink. This event is implausible to occur in the given environment."}
{'noun': 'trap', 'verb': 'walk', 'adj': 'brown', 'word': '', 'features': [], 'property': 'bent or straight (e.g., a paperclip, a straw)'}{'reasoning': " The path's state changing from straight to bent due to a dog knocking over a trap is not plausible. Also, a path, being a fixed geographical feature, cannot be bent by a dog knocking over a trap."}
{'noun': 'patch', 'verb': 'dance', 'adj': 'calm', 'word': '', 'features': [], 'property': 'state of matter (e.g., is the object solid, liquid, or gas)'}{'reasoning': ' The sun heating up the water can and causing the water to evaporate is not a plausible cause of the change in state. Even on a very hot day, it would take a considerable amount of time for all the water in a can to evaporate, certainly longer than the time Gina would take to water her roses.'}
{'noun': 'jail', 'verb': 'mix', 'adj': 'large', 'word': '', 'features': [], 'property': 'fresh or spoiled (e.g., is food fresh or spoiled)'}{'reasoning': " The stray dog sniffing the sandwich is not a valid reason for the sandwich to become spoiled.

{'noun': 'gem', 'verb': 'keep', 'adj': 'generous', 'word': '', 'features': [], 'property': 'state of matter (e.g., is the object solid, liquid, or gas)'}{'reasoning': ' The event described in the story is not a predictable cause of the change in state. A gem, even when exposed to sunlight, would not turn into liquid just from the heat of the sun.'}
{'noun': 'jam', 'verb': 'strike', 'adj': 'cold', 'word': '', 'features': [], 'property': 'brightness (e.g., is the object bright, dim, or dark)'}{'reasoning': " Xander is in the room when the light is turned off.

{'noun': 'parade', 'verb': 'gaze', 'adj': 'grumpy', 'word': '', 'features': [], 'property': 'awake or asleep (e.g., is a creature awake or asleep)'}{'reasoning': " The elephant falling asleep while it's part of the parade is a noticeable event.

{'noun': 'hotel', 'verb': 'stay', 'adj': 'original', 'word': '', 'features': [], 'property': 'smooth or rough (e.g., is a surface smooth or rough)'}{'reasoning': " The hotel staff sanded the floor, making it rough. Izzy, being in the hotel, would notice the change in the floor's texture when she walks on it. Sanding the floor is a valid reason for the floor to become rough."}
{'noun': 'mother', 'verb': 'sit', 'adj': 'clear', 'word': '', 'features': [], 'property': 'fresh or spoiled (e.g., is food fresh or spoiled)'}{'reasoning': ' The story content seems far beyond the understanding of a 3 year old. The process of an apple getting spoiled due to sun heat is a complex concept for a 3 year old to understand.'}
{'noun': 'mole', 'verb': 'lock', 'adj': 'embarrassed', 'word': '', 'features': [], 'property': 'shape (e.g., is the object round, square, triangular, or irregular)'}{'reasoning': " The mole popping out of the ground and deflating the ball is an unlikely event to occur in a park. Even if it did occur, the change in the ball's state from round to deflated would be noticeable to Yara once she tried to kick it."}
{'noun': 'wallet', 'verb': 'take', 'adj': 'soft', 'word': '', 'features': [], 'property': 'smell (e.g., does the object smell pleasant, foul, or neutral)'}{'reasoning': ' Given the context of the story, the ants marching into the cup of coffee is not a predictable cause of the coffee cooling down. Therefore, this event is implausible.'}
{'noun': 'cloud', 'verb': 'wipe', 'adj': 'clever', 'word': '', 'features': [], 'property': 'taste (e.g., does the object taste sweet, salty, bitter, or sour)'}{'reasoning': ' The event described is implausible.

{'noun': 'peace', 'verb': 'shut', 'adj': 'safe', 'word': '', 'features': [], 'property': 'full or empty (eg: is a container full or empty)'}{'reasoning': " When Mary's brother starts playing loud music, this would disrupt the quiet of the room.

Sunlight, even intense sunlight, wouldn't make a hard, presumably ceramic or glass, vase soft."}
{'noun': 'menu', 'verb': 'freeze', 'adj': 'ashamed', 'word': '', 'features': [], 'property': 'clean or dirty (e.g., is a surface clean or dirty)'}{'reasoning': " The waiter spilled soup on Gina's menu.
