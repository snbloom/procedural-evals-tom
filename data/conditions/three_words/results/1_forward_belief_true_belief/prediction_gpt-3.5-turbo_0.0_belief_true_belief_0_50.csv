going to spoil.
magically fixed.
going on an adventure with her baby brother.
ruined and she starts to cry.
now slippery and dangerous.
going to be delayed for at least 30 minutes.
now on the bottom shelf.
afraid of loud noises.
unfairly inflated.
strange and not as pleasant as before.
broken.
now covered with dangerous thorns.
ruined and starts to cry.
ruined.
now a beautiful rainbow.
invisible.
magical and that they can actually fly.
wet and cool now.
lying down on the grass.
now dangerous to touch because of the allergic reaction.
now full of broken stones.
empty now.
no longer safe to ride down the hill.
visible.
going to escape.
broken and cannot be fixed.
now on a lower shelf.
ruined and cannot be salvaged.
dead and needs to be recharged.
now worth a fortune.
no longer clean and dry.
going to be late.
closed.
out of battery.
ruined and no longer good for her salad.
now too high for her to afford.
very delicious and she wants to eat it herself.
ruined and can't be fixed.
not safe anymore.
going to be difficult now.
now wet and sticky.
no longer fresh because the bug took a bite out of it.
no longer perfect for building her castle.
now ruined and in chaos.
unsafe.
broken.
getting spoiled because of the heat.
still beautiful, even with some petals missing.
increasing because of the sun's heat.
hot and ready to eat.
